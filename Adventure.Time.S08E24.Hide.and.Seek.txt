[The episode begins as a flashback. Young Kara (Susan Strong) trains with other Seekers under Dr. Gross's supervision.]
[Snarling sounds from a creature]
Dr. Gross:  Kara. Kara. Kara!
Kara:  Yes, Dr. Gross?
Dr. Gross:  That's quite a scenic landscape out there, but was it always so lush?
Kara:  No, it used to be a desert island.
Dr. Gross:  Very good, Kara. It was once barren, but we intervened. Like all of the islands, we helped it grow. And do you Seekers know why?
[The Seekers sing the Founders Song.]
Seekers:  [singing] ♪ We had to leave our place because the world was dyin' ♪ And everyone that wasn't dead spent all of their time cryin' ♪ Our ways had failed, nature had failed, we made a lot of errors ♪ The Founders had some new ideas that made everything better ♪ The Founders dreamt of this island, our ships landed on its shore ♪ They built our wonderful Guardian to keep destruction from our door ♪ The Hiders fear these new ideas but do your best to help them ♪ 'Cause just outside is darkness and death, disease, monsters, and problems ♪ So come out of your hiding place, come out of the darkness ♪ And we'll find a new way to live by the light of the Founders ♪
Dr. Gross:  [claps] Let's get to today's lesson. Please, load lesson 38B.
Automated Voice:  Educating. Educating. [ding] Lesson uploaded.
Dr. Gross:  Yes, power up! All right, Seekers, remember your homework -- 50 deadlifts by tomorrow.
[Scene changes to Kara walking with her friend Frieda.]
Kara:  So how's your Experimenter classes going, Frieda?
Frieda:  Eh. It's all intro stuff for kids. Look at this janky thing. [babyish voice] I'm a dumb toy for babies! [normal voice] Experimenter stuff's just boring.
Kara:  Boring can still be important. It's all part of the Founders' plan.
Frieda:  Are you freestyling your own verse to that nerdy Founders song?
Kara:  No, but that song is deeply satisfying.
Frieda:  Chillax, K-Bot. You're getting big and hunky.
Kara:  Yeah! Being a Seeker's great! I love my beefy...bod. [laughs nervously] Heh.
[Scene changes to present day. On the boat, the crew has landed on an island.]
Jake:  [startled] Aah!
Finn:  Oh hey, I think it...stopped!
[Thud]
BMO:  Uhh! Aah! Ohh! Whee! Aah!
Jake:  Huh. This was more fun in my dreams.
Finn:  Dudes, I found Susan!
Jake:  Susan! Susan!
Finn:  Susan. What's up with her, man?
Jake:  I think she's sleepwalking. Let's just find out where she's going.
Susan:  [sleepwalking, haltingly] Find them, catch them. Find them, catch them.
[Scene changes back to flashback. Dr. Gross leads a Seeker mission.]
Dr. Gross:  [amplified voice] Find them, catch them! [siren wails] Bring back those Hiders, y'all! Your implants have made you stronger and better!
Hider:  [trying to escape] Wait! I'll help you! Hey there! Wink! [ding] Hmf. You didn't think that was cute? Hatcha! Come on, I'm innocent, I tells you! I'm just a handsome bystander! [gets caught] Aah! Ooh! [whimpers]
Crowd:  Kara! Kara! Kara!
Seekers:  [chanting] Find them! Catch them! Help them! Find them! Catch them! Help them!
[Scene changes to a hospital. Kara delivers a captured Hider to Dr. Minerva.]
P.A. Announcer:  New patient for Dr. Minerva on Deck 3.
Minerva:  What do you got for me, Kara?
Kara:  A sad ol' Hider with two busted legs.
Minerva:  Oh, I love busted legs! [chuckles] When will he be at full health?
Kara:  Tomorrow morning.
Minerva:  Okay, I'll have a transport here in the morning to shuttle him to re-ed. [yawns] [Kara's joints pop as she stretches. Door whooshes. Mattress creaks as she lies down.]
[Scene changes to present day. Finn and Jake watch Susan sleepwalk.]
Jake:  What's she doing?
Finn:  I think she's, uh, getting ready to sleepwalk-sleep.
Jake:  Man, this island is nasty. Who'd want to live here?
[Scene changes back to flashback. Kara and Frieda stargaze together.]
Frieda:  [bouncing on something] You know, there are people on the other side of the world that are never gonna see these stars.
Kara:  That's bunk, Frieda. We're the only people left. The islands are like a beautiful safe haven.
Frieda:  I've read all the old stories about 'em, you know? About other places and people. I'd like to see those places one day, and meet those people. They can't all be monsters.
Kara:  You can't say that, Frieda.
Frieda:  Oh, relax. I'm just globbin'. Hey, watch this. [presses button, static crackles on screen]
Kara:  [laughs] That's not what I look like.
Frieda:  Yeah, it is! Come on, flex! [laughs] See?
Kara:  [looks at screen] Wow. Am I really that buff? I look great! Don't you just love this place?
Frieda:  [sighs] Yeah. Yeah.
[Scene changes to a classroom on Founders Friday.]
Teacher:  Okay, class, before we start today's lesson, I need to announce that we're missing a number of contrapulators and an expensive unilateral phase detractor. If you're using these items for personal projects, you need to first equip them in your character file, okay? Since today is Founders Friday, we're going to sing our Founders Song.
[Equipment blips]
Frieda:  I have to go pee!
Teacher:  Kara!
[Kara chases after Frieda. Panting, metal jangles.]
Kara:  Frieda? Frieda, no! What are you doing?
Frieda:  Go back to class, Kara. You didn't see me.
Kara:  Stop running!
Frieda:  Stop chasing!
[They both trip and fall with a loud thud. Groaning.]
Kara:  Frieda, are you trying to leave us? Leave me?
Frieda:  I was gonna write a note. Listen, someone might see us out here. We can talk in that cave.
Kara:  Wha-- No, you don't have to carry me! [gasps] Uhh! What is that?
Frieda:  [reveals a boat] It's a foolproof way outta here.
Kara:  But why? We're safe here.
Frieda:  We have no freedom, Kara! I want to see what's out there.
Kara:  It's all just bad stuff out there. You're only gonna get hurt.
Frieda:  Maybe. But maybe getting hurt isn't the worst thing there is. I want to be me, and that's never gonna happen here.
Kara:  Frieda, I'm sorry, I just --
Frieda:  But you can help me! I'm only missing the engine now, see? And you're so strong, you can carry it in one trip.
Kara:  This is... I have to go...think.
Frieda:  Uh, okay. I'll be here. Hey, Kara. You're not gonna tell on me, right?
Kara:  It's gonna be okay.
[Scene changes to Kara visiting Dr. Gross in her office.]
Kara:  Dr. Gross?
Dr. Gross:  Kara! My teacher's pet. And you know I mean that in a good way. Listen, um, sorry about running off earlier.
Kara:  When you gotta go, you gotta go. But that's not really what you wanna talk about, right?
Dr. Gross:  Well, you know how you always say that humans will find the best way?
Kara:  The Founders get credit for that bit of wisdom.
Dr. Gross:  If someone found a way, that's, uh, different from ours, but seems to work for them, couldn't that also be a good way?
Kara:  Ah. You've heard some Hider preaching, haven't you? Well, listen, kid. We tried exploring the outside world, and we were almost destroyed! We're the last humans, so it's our responsibility to stay here, and it's your responsibility to help these misguided Hiders.
Dr. Gross:  [resigned] Right.
[Scene changes to Kara bringing the engine to Frieda in the cave. Loud clank.]
Kara:  Your engine.
Frieda:  [excited] You just broke it!
Kara:  What?!
Frieda:  [laughs] I'm kidding. It must weigh, like, a ton. How would you have done this... [grunts lifting it] without me?
Kara:  I don't know, maybe roll it on tubes, or find some hunky Hider somewhere?
Frieda:  Mm, you better hurry. I'll give you a push off so they don't hear the engine. Come with me, Kara.
Kara:  Frieda, I'm --
Dr. Gross:  [appearing suddenly] Kara! Thanks for the tip, my loyal, faithful Seeker. Go fetch.
[Electricity surges through Kara's implant.]
Frieda:  Kara?
Kara:  [robotic voice] Target acquired.
Frieda:  Aah! Kara, no! Stop! Ow!
Kara:  [robotic] Initiate grabbing.
Frieda:  [struggling] Ah!
Kara:  [robotic] Eliminating transport.
[Kara destroys Frieda's boat.]
Frieda:  No! Stop it! Don't! No!
Kara:  [crying, fighting the control] Why? Oh, Kara, why?
Frieda:  [sobbing] No. Why?
Dr. Gross:  That's enough, XJ-7-7. Let's go home.
[Scene changes to present day. Susan stops walking and hums the Founders Song.]
Jake:  I'm pretty sure she's awake. She's got that "Focused Stank" about her.
Finn:  Susan, are you okay?
Susan:  [turns to face them] Kara. My name is Kara.
[Wind whistles. The episode ends.]
