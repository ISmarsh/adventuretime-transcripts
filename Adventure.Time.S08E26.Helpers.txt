[The episode begins with Finn, Jake, Kara, and BMO flying toward Founders Island in a small ship.]
Kara:  We're closing in on Minerva's brainwave signature. We should touch down in just a few minutes.
Finn:  [looking at a map of brain activity] Whoa. So, that's what my mom's thoughts look like. They look good. I think.
Jake:  Hold on.
Finn:  Whoa. That's her?
Kara:  Mm-hmm. Dr. Minerva.
Jake:  She looks nice.
[Beeping]
Kara:  We're here, Finn. Buckle up. I'm gonna take us down.
Finn:  [looking out the window] Humans. There's so many.
Jake:  Are they friendly, Kara? The people here?
Kara:  [chuckles] Don't worry, you're gonna fit right in.
[They land on the island.]
Kara:  Finn? Hey, listen. I remember enough about my old life to know that there were some dangerous people here. So let's stick together, okay? And let's all try to keep a low profile.
Jake:  [immediately yelling] Minerva! Minerva! Hey, you, where's Minerva?
Citizen:  Wha! Geez. You scared me with that costume, citizen.
Jake:  Don't change the subject. Now, where's Minerva? And does she have any chips or crackers or anything? I'm getting real tired of picking batteries out of these BMO cakes.
Citizen:  Where's Minerva? Man, that's a pretty weird question. Minerva's everywhere. Additionally, everyone knows that. Just look around for somebody who needs help, and Minerva will be there helping, obviously. "Where's Minerva?" [chuckles]
Jake:  Thanks.
Finn:  She's everywhere? You hear that, man?
Jake:  Minerva's into helping people, just like you. She must've gave you her helper genes as DNA up in her womb with your placenta.
Finn:  DN-what-what?
[A group of children notice Jake.]
Kid:  Mister? Can I rub the dog's tummy, mister? He's got a cute yellow tummy.
Jake:  Shoot, kid, you don't even have to ask. Just scooch right up and get busy.
Kid:  [gasps] You're a talking dog! Teesa, Meeka, Gee-gee, come look! A talking dog!
Jake:  Are they gonna help with the tummy rub?
[Kids giggle and gather around Jake.]
[Finn spots a Minerva-bot nearby.]
Kara:  Finn, look.
Finn:  Oh, geez. I didn't think we would find her so fast.
Kara:  We can come with you if you'd like.
Finn:  Nope. Finn only.
Minerva-bot:  Hello, young man. Is there anything I can help you with?
Finn:  [breathes deeply] This is gonna sound weird, but... and I don't mean to put you on the spot. But, uh...did you... did you lose... a son?
Minerva-bot:  [turns away] Careful, citizens. Litter can be unattractive, but dangerous, as well.
Finn:  Uh...
Minerva-bot:  [turns back, repeating] Hello, young man. Is there anything I can help you with?
Finn:  This is going a lot different than I pictured it.
[Meanwhile, Jake entertains the crowd of children.]
Jake:  Come on, now. Are you telling me none of you has ever seen a talking dog before? That's crazy. That's even crazier than the old lady who lives alone on that weather island.
[Laughter]
Jake:  [laughs] No, but seriously, if you think this is impressive, you should've seen me at the flea circus. I really stole the show.
[Laughter]
Jake:  [chuckles] Nah, but seriously, y'all should really meet my friend BMO.
Kara:  [whispering] Jake.
Jake:  He's a talking calculator.
Kara:  Now's not the time.
Jake:  Now there's a friend you can really... Whoop! ...count on.
[Laughter]
Kara:  [spots someone in the crowd] Frieda.
Jake:  Wow, listen, you guys are great. I got to get going and find my friends, but man, what a great crowd, though, seriously.
Crowd:  One more joke.
[Cheering]
Jake:  That's all I got. I don't know any more jokes.
[Crowd "Awwww"s]
Jake:  Wait, wait. I can do other stuff besides jokes. Like, um, oh. [inhales deeply and stretches his face] Pbbbbbbbbbt!
Kid:  Huh?
[The citizens see Jake's stretching and panic.]
Citizen:  Mutant!
Citizen 2:  Mutant.
Citizen 3:  He's a mutant.
Citizen 4:  Is he a mutant?
Jake:  What? No, no, no. I'm just a regular dog, see? [pants]
Citizens:  [gasp]
Citizen:  He's a mutant.
Citizen 2:  A mutant!
Citizens:  [calling out] Minerva! Minerva! Minerva!
[Multiple Minerva-bots arrive.]
Finn:  I guess this must be pretty shocking. Oh, are you in shock? Do you need help?
Citizen:  Minerva!
Citizens:  Minerva! Minerva! Minerva! Minerva, help!
Finn:  Oh, hey, Minerva.
Jake:  Finn, I found Miner-- Uh, disregard.
Minerva-bot:  You are creating a disturbance. Please help let us help you help us to sedate you.
Jake:  I'm not a mutant. I'm magic. I think. Although, now that you men-- [gets sedated, groans]
Finn:  Stop! He's my brother! And I'm your suhhh...
Kara:  [helping] Son!
[Scene changes to Finn and Jake in restraints.]
Jake:  What's this? [grunts, trying to break free] You can't get them off. I tried a lot already.
Finn:  I love you, but your mom's a hundred robo-clones. Those things aren't my mom. Maybe they look like my mom because they did something to her, right? I'm going to get out of here and I'm going to rescue her, and I'll hug her, and -- and --
Jake:  I've had weirder fights than this. Where da bones?
Finn:  Thas muh hand.
[Finn's robot arm whirs, clicks, and dings. It releases them. They gasp. Horns honk as they emerge into a digital space.]
Finn:  Uh... [pop!]
[Scene changes to BMO and Kara outside a toy store.]
BMO:  It's a toy store! Are you going to buy me a toy?
Kara:  No. Well, maybe. I have to talk to my friend first.
BMO:  Mm-hmm.
Kara:  I made a mistake a long time ago. My friend got hurt. I don't know if I'm allowed back in her life.
BMO:  Mm-hmm.
[Scene changes to Finn in a virtual space. He meets the real Minerva, now a digital consciousness.]
Jake:  [splashing through data] Where are we going, man? What is this? Am I dreaming?
Finn:  [sees a woman's form] Who are you? Uh, my name's Finn. Are you my m--
Minerva:  [emotional] It is you. Oh my gosh, I can't believe you're alive! [to a bot] Minerva-bot, hug my son.
Finn:  You're beautiful.
Minerva:  [laughs] My boy, baby Finn! Oh, you're so big. Last time I saw you, you were 6.875 kilograms, and now look at you!
Finn:  Mom...
Minerva:  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm babbling. Yes, darling?
Finn:  What happened to you? You've been gone for so long.
Minerva:  When you and Martin disappeared, I was left fragile as an eggshell. Martin is a hider. He left with our baby. Dr. Gross was resolute. She immediately activated her most powerful seeker to bring you back. But years went by. You and your father were never coming back. Dark days grew darker. I went into myself, and while I retreated, Dr. Gross's work turned strange and dangerous.
[Flashback shows Dr. Gross experimenting.]
Dr. Gross:  Aroo?
Minerva:  Dr. Gross's actions unwittingly led to the release of a terrible virus.
[Glass shatters in the flashback.]
Minerva:  It was the most catastrophic event that had happened to our species in 300 years. We tried to consolidate and quarantine everyone on Founders Island. The fatality rate in the general population grew to 62%. But the fatality rate in helpers, those who faced the virus daily, was 100%. Or nearly. I was only one helper and in no condition to do my job.
[Flashback shows Minerva sick, coughing.]
Minerva:  I made my decision. With my brain-map uploaded to the Web, I could be hundreds of helpers. And humanity needed help above all else. Since that day, I have protected and cared for all my people the best I could.
Finn:  [sniffles]
Minerva:  But that all doesn't matter anymore. You're back! And now you can live here in safety.
Finn:  Oh, but I can't necessarily --
Minerva:  For the rest of your life.
[The episode ends with Minerva smiling, waiting for Finn's response.]
