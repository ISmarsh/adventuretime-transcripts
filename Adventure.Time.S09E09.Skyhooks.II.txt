Give me them jewels, Finn.We're out of time.

[ Cackles ]

Now, let's grab LSP and getthe buns out of here.

Huh!

[ Laughs ]

♪ Let me hear you whisper ♪

Aah!

You left my friend Finn down there.

I'm sorry, but we don't need him anymore.

But don't worry,I've got a new plan.

A plan where nothing that happens here matters.

Okay, but we should turn back still.

Finn loves me.

He sees me as, like,a handsome older brother.

Mm, no.I'm doing the right thing.

Can't go around it,got to go through it.

Lumpy Space Princess,

you were buried in candy and it didn’t change you at all.

Why doesn't this elemental stuff affect you?

I'm a tough tranch!

People don't tell me what to do,

I tell them what to do!

Okay, but it has to be more than that.

Like, you're not from around Ooo, not really.

Maybe you're not made of the same stuff as us.

Hmm.

Lumps! Lumps are the subspace molecular lattice

that binds together the scientific and magical

forces of Ooo ‐‐more powerful than

any one element,it's the force that

orders reality into its true shape.

And, LSP, this part is very,very important ‐‐

Grrr!No more learning!

[ Car horn beeps ]

Hey, Michael!Let's get married.

Wait, what?

Michael.

LSP, This is important.

I think they were trying to tell you ‐‐

you're the anti‐elemental.

Fire, Ice, Candy, Slime and...

Lumps![ Gasps ]

[ Hums ]

Huh?

I must have dozed off...

and bound myself.

Ouch!

[ Clears throat ]

People say you shouldn’t live in the past!

But I say, "Why not?"

I love it.

This book is strange,

but when you puzzle it out,

it's mostly all charges and frequencies.

Instead of fixing Ooo,

I can use these jewels to make a portal

to take me back in time and find Simon

before he discovers the crown.

Uh‐huh.

This time I won’t let him put it on.

I'll drop it in a volcano before that happens.

Things will be back to being just me and Simon,

and you won't exist!

Mm‐hm, mm‐hm.

No more Ice King,no more magic Betty ‐‐

maybe I can even stop the Mushroom War!

[ Laughs ]

Cool.Now where do I come in?

You're not listening.

My wonderful Simon will never become this sad,

pathetic creature strewn before me.

Wait, what?

I thought I could do it,but I can't.

Being with you is like looking at my old life

through a funhouse mirror.

[ Laughs ]It's driving me mad.

Goodbye, Ice King.

[ Machine whirs ]

Okay, I think this is a pretty good breakdown

of your components.

We just need to figure out a way

to tap into your pureanti‐elemental essence, LSP.

[ Sighs ] Don't tell mewhat to do, Finn.

Yeah, like that.

Pb is undiluted sweetness now,

and Slime Princess has never been slimier.

I think you might need to be the most you that you've ever been.

You just have to believe in yourself.

I do believe myself.

I'm a blossoming debutanteon the war path.

Wenk!

Ahhhhh!

Wenk!

Wenk! Wenk‐wenk! Wenk, wenk,wenk, wenk.

[ Purrs ]See?

It's working.

Ugh!You okay?

Just relax, you'll be obliterated soon.

Really? Lady, this Simon sounds cool, but I'm Ice King.

I, uh, I guessI'm a special person

and I am worthy of respect.

Just ‐‐ shh!It'll be over in a second.

Can you turn this off and we can talk, maybe?

Nertz.

Huh.

Boy, did I fail deep.

Well, maybe I'll try again inanother 1,000 years.

I'm not sticking around to seehow this ends.

Mr. Fox, please roll me someplace safe.

Oh, oh, wow. Okay.

Ding‐dong.

It's me, classic Ice King!

Si‐men!

I didn't like being ditched earlier,

but if you and Betty are cool now,

you can help us figure out how to use LSP's power.

Wait, where's Betty?

Who?

Here, I bet this thing can help you.

[ Gasps ] It's Gunter!Hey, Gunter! Come here, boy.

Okay, fair.

Hey, LSP, now that we've got the Enchiridion,

maybe we can study it for a way to figu‐‐

No more studying!

All day long you've been telling me what to do.

I already saved your life,so quit telling me what to do.

Huh?

What's happening?

The jewels.

Oh!What if your force of will

is influencing and attracting elemental magic.

You mean these jewels love me

more than they love those dumb‐dumbs?

[ Laughs ]

Wenk! Wenk! Wenk!And you!

Clam your face, you noid!

Okay.

Hey, Slime Princess.

Oh! Hello, Jake.

Uh, did you recently get a haircut?

Unnnh. Lumps.

Oh, LSP.

Please be careful with yourself.

Ha‐ha, fine, I guess.

Yeah, that's all of them!

[ Groans ]

LSP!

[ Weakly ]I'm a hero.

Whoops.

You did it.

She did it!

[ Cheers and applause ]

Uh, I'd like to date you, LSP.

Thank you, Starchy.

Wait, where ‐‐Up here.

[ Clicks tongue ]You really donked up.

Finn?Jake?

Finn!

Oh, my gosh!

Come here.

What?Over here.

Hey, buddy.

Jake? Are you okay?

Yeah...[ Chuckles ]

You know, everything looks different after a long trip.

You and I can fix whatever this is together, whenever.

Fix what now?

I was really scared when you left.

You're my best brother.

I love you.
