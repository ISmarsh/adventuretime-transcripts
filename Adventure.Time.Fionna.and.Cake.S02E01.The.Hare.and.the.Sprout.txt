Astrid:  It all started when Prismo the Wishmaster, made a wish. He made a new version of Finn The Human. A girl named Fionna. But her magical world turned into a boring one. So she went on a quest to fix it. First, she came to our world of Ooo. And after I reunited her with Cake, we became best friends.
Simon:  Is that really what happened, Astrid?
Astrid:  Yes. Yes, it did. After visiting a bunch of universes...
Winter King:  Help me!
[-Hyah! -Grrr!]
Astrid:  ...Fionna decided she liked her world the way it was. Fionna returned home and saved it from being destroyed by an evil bug. Then, some magical stuff happened. And now, Fionna is her own person. Not just a copy of Finn.
Bubblegum:  That reminds me. Where is Finn? I haven't seen him in a while.
Simon:  Last I saw, he was heading to Huntress Wizard's Place. Wait, those two are back on again? Hmm.
Marceline:  I gotta give that girl a call.
Bubblegum:  You have her number? No.
[Astrid clears throat]
Astrid:  And so Fionna lived happily ever after.
[electronic music playing]
Astrid:  [on radio] You're listening to the Original GROF. My name is DJ Slime. You know, that song always reminds me of my many failings. Seriously, how bad can I feel about myself?
[Fionna groans]
Fionna:  Well, anyway, I got the hot, hot, hottest new single from DJ Flame.
[music starts playing]
[music stops]
Announcer:  Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Norm:  Hey, not feeling so great, Sammy. I tell ya my dogs are barkin' so much, I'm issuing a noise complaint!
[audience laughing]
Norm:  My friends, defend the castle! [Celine grunting on tv] Blood! Blood everywhere! Heh heh, cool.
[sniffs]
Norm:  Cake! Hey, Babyface. Wanna come over for breakfast before we bounce? Or are you too busy being an independent single gal living it up in your brand new apartment?
[Fionna whooping]
Fionna:  Well, it depends. Whacha cooking? I got waffles... I got hot dogs! Hmm. [clicks tongue] What do people normally pick? Mmm.
[munching]
Fionna:  Mmm. Why pick? I'll just stick with the coffee.
[gulps]
Fionna:  [shudders] Ugh! Okay, Cake. We got a big day... today! Wa...wa...wait. My pants!
[opening theme music playing]
Fionna:  ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪
[theme music ends]
[Fionna straining]
Fionna:  Woaah! Oof! Beep, beep, beep. Sure do appreciate the help, Fionna. My back is just so horribly jacked up. Just doin' my part. If you had this kind of hustle before, I woulda kept you on. Here's those fairy lights you asked about. Marshall's gonna love these. How's that tarp holding up? Gotta go. Thanks for the lights. [clicks tongue] Fix that hole, girl. Miss Campbell. As a token of appreciation for saving our fair city, 15 percent off your order. Killer. And, uh... Apologies for firing you last year. It's cool. I... I sucked. There, there. I wonder what Gary's baking up today. Probably something elaborate and delish. Magic Kitty!
[-That's me, honey. -[gasps]]
Fionna:  C...c...can you turn into a elephant? Sure.
[grunts]
Fionna:  How about a horse?
[grunting]
Girl:  Do a cowboy riding a horse riding an elephant!
[laughs heartily]
Girl:  [crying] So cool!
Girl:  I love you! What's next on the list, Fi? Mmm. Super fine, dark cocoa powder. [gasps] Cocoa. You know what that means. Zip it, Fionna.
[laughing]
Girl:  And on your left, you'll see more destruction brought to our fair city by none other than this total deadbeat. Fionna Campbell.
[indistinct chatter]
Girl:  It's Fionna! Fun fact, I fired her messy ass. I... I saved your life, Queenie. And what do you want? A widdle trophy? The only reward I need is never working for you. Cheapskate. [all] Oooh!
[-She called you cheap. -[growls] Stop the bus!]
Girl:  The simpletons of this city might love you for now. But deep down, you know, you're a true loser.
[-[growls] -Woah, there, Fi.]
Girl:  She's not worth it.
[-Jumped up Abadeer wannabe! -[growls]]
Girl:  Chill, Fionna! Heh heh heh. Come on, Cake. We got a mission. Wait! Woo-sah. Okay, we can go in now.
[bell dinging]
[-Hi, M-Cron. -Hey, man.]
Girl:  Is that a new hoodie? Candy! For me? Thank you.
[-Eh, eh. -Shh.]
Girl:  Go find the cocoa! So, what's in these? Pumpkin? These are great! Even better than mice!
[winces]
Girl:  I mean, I don't-- I don't eat mice... Anymore. Special cocoa. Special cocoa. Special cocoa. No! No, no, no, no, no, please! Ah! Half off! Perfect. Where the heck...? [mumbles imperceptibly] Aha! Hey! Ah, wonderful. This will ensure that my lava cakes are truly... [clicks] Thanks for picking it off the shelf for me, sweetie.
[grunts]
Girl:  Gary... needs... this! Yeah, I like fish sticks!
[thud]
[-Fionna? -[Cutter groans]]
Girl:  I got the cocoa!
Cutter:  Dork! Pay that beautiful man! Oh!
[Cutter groans]
[-Hey, girl. -Fionna,]
Cutter:  you know, it's hard enough for me to keep my cool without you trashing his store. Here's your stuff. Hey, I think this one's for you.
[giggles]
[phone vibrating]
[-Simon! -Hey, Simon.]
Cutter:  Hey, girl. I'm out for a walk. Thought I'd check in. See how you're doing. Oh, we're doing... [shudders] good. We're doing good. So how's living with Marcy? Everything cool?
Simon:  Oh, It's great! Little crowded. And she likes to play music very loudly late at night. And I always feel a bit awkward around PB, you know? I used to kidnap her and stuff. I think we're cool, but I can never tell with her. Marcy has been a sweetheart, though. They're both sweethearts, really. I shouldn't complain. So all in all, it's pretty good? Yeah! And I leave for Wiz Arts tomorrow, so... Oh, right! Are you excited? I am. I enjoy teaching and being around magic. Though magic did ruin my relationship and drive me insane for centuries. But I'm in a better place now.
Fionna:  Yeah, I'm proud of you. Yeah. So how's the Sweet Spot coming along? Great! Grand opening tomorrow. Wish you could be there. Oh! That's big. Are you bringing anyone special? Nah, I'm not even thinking about that stuff right now. Cake! We're supposed to put those up all over town!
[smiles sheepishly]
Fionna:  Simon, I gotta go.
[-Okay. Have fun. -You too. [hangs up]]
Fionna:  Eh, nothing rhymes with orange.
[mysterious music playing]
[sighs in exasperation]
[groans softly]
Fionna:  [weakly] Huntress...Wizard...
[metal clanking]
[wings flapping]
Fionna:  Rad.
[whooshing]
Fionna:  Oh, yeah. Brekkie Huntress.
[squelching]
Fionna:  [gulps] Thanks, babe.
[roars]
Fionna:  Finn? What's all this biz? Have you been training animals to feed you? Finn?
[-Boy, you so lazy? -[winces]]
[-[groans] -Huh?]
Fionna:  [whispers] Hickory nuts.
Fionna:  Peanuts, macadamia nuts, and almonds.
[-Done. -Mmm.]
[sighs]
Fionna:  Yo, Gare! Delivery! Fionna! Cake! Did you get the cocoa powder? Yep. This is it. See? Told you I could get everything in one day. Procrastination has no consequences.
Squirrel:  I think I'm in my Impressionist period. I don't paint, I have no desire to paint. But if I did paint, I feel like that would really be my thing. I... until I grew out of it, you know? Yo, Ellis. Hey, girls. Give me some sugar. Whoo! I'd also like the loan of sugar.
Fionna:  Marshall! Hey, Marshall!
[hisses]
Fionna:  Think fast. Sick. Can't wait to bloody these up. Babe, ew. Here, I made Thank-You pastries.
[laughs exultantly]
Fionna:  Oh! Can I have the cream puff? [both] Mmm. How much do I owe you for the stuff? Don't worry about it. I like helping my friends. You're the best, Fi. What would we do without you? Eh, it's nothing.
[strumming guitar]
[phone vibrating]
Hunter:  Fionna. Aaah! [sighs] Oh, Hunter. These roses keep springing up all over the park. They remind me of Rosa rubiginosa.
[sniffs]
Hunter:  Hmm? I thought you'd like one. Oh! For here. Oh, yeah, right. Thanks. You're...you're bleeding. Huh. Does it hurt? [scoffs] Nope. Hey, Hunter. You stickin' around? We're gonna have a little celebration. No, I should head out. I have an early day tomorrow. Good night, friends. Have a great day. You gonna walk H home? No. Are you? Who's ready for drinks? Ding, ding, ding, ding. Friends, my dreams are finally coming true. Even better than I envisioned them. And I finally have a backyard. And it's thanks to all of you. And especially, my best friend, my hero, Fionna. Love you. To the morrow! [all cheering] To the morrow!
[rasping]
Hunter:  Hyper viper. Bleh.
[grunts annoyingly]
[coughing]
[-[groans] -Finn, what poisoned you?]
Hunter:  A cockatrice? A naga? A medium sized Manticore? Cone snail. I've never met a non-tranchy cone snail. [coughs] [weakly] Fought... a... bear.
[-Simon. -Simon?]
Hunter:  Ice King Simon?
[groans weakly]
Hunter:  Finn? Finn!
[soldiers battling]
[panting]
[grunting]
Hunter:  C'mon!
[soldiers grunting]
[soldiers groaning]
[groans]
Hunter:  Ugh.
[Young Fionna grunting]
Hunter:  Ha! Cake!
[-Taste my gut! -[soldiers screaming]]
[soldier panting]
[laughing]
[Fionna panting]
[-Wohoo! -[laughs]]
Gary:  Help me. Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me, Fionna! Help me!
[gasps]
[creaking]
Gary:  Help me! Ayudame. Damn! Little help?
[-Aah! -Aaah!]
Gary:  There! Fionna?
[sharp gasp]
[both screaming]
[-Aaah! -I'm out baby.]
[gong ringing]
[gong ringing again]
[groans softly]
[-Wake up! -Aah!]
Gary:  [snorts] We killed Gary!
[-What's that? -[Queenie snaps fingers]]
Gary:  Huh?
Fionna:  Woah. Even before the world got wrecked, this place used to be a real dump.
[Ellis grumbles]
Ellis:  But you idiots really made something of it. Huh? Ugh, shove off, witch! What? From my own property? Buh? That's right. This place belongs to me!
[-What? -[both] Ah!]
[screaming]
[-Aah! -Aah!]
[bells chiming]
[indistinct chatter]
[chalk squeaking]
Ellis:  This is History of Magic Artifacts with Simon Petrikov. and I "arti" give you the "facts". Heh. [sarcastically] Woah, Simon. You're teaching a class about yourself? You know, because you're so old. Hi, Pep. Ooh! I almost forgot. Mommies say hi.
[growls]
Ellis:  Now, you might have heard I was something of an Ice King. And while I'm still a pretty cool guy, I promise I have put that drama behind me.
[-[ceiling crashes] -[students screaming]]
[all gasp]
Ellis:  [groans] Big Beagle! Huntress Wizard?
[-W...What are you--? -Explain.]
Ellis:  Oh Finn... I was attacked by a green bear.
[growling]
Ellis:  When Finn swooped in to save me, he was thrown violently into this weird, thorny bush. Bush! Where? He called it... The Heart of the Forest. Keep him alive. Forget everything you heard about that place.
[-[whooshes] -Huh?]
Ellis:  Wait! Don't go!
[groans weakly]
[growling]
Ellis:  My house is in there. My dreams are in there. They're my dreams now. It's called back rent. [growling] You can't do this! I can did this.
[-[grunts] -[thuds]]
[both growling]
Gary:  Everything I've worked for... It's all gone. Hey, don't be sad. I don't know how yet, but I'm gonna fix this.
[sniffs]
Gary:  Bear stank.
[gasps]
