[The episode begins at the Candy Kingdom castle. A Candy Child wants to go outside.]
Candy Child:  Mom! I wanna play outside with Consuelo!
Candy Mom:  Cool your jets! It is super dangerous outside. Little kids have to stay in the castle.
Candy Child:  But I'm rowdy!
Candy Mom:  Yeah, well, but look -- see what happens? [shows a picture] You want a playdate with death? That's why you have to stay inside! And 'cause Consuelo's mom is a pain in the neck. [gasps] In the heat of the sun, you burn like a pink little baby!
[Scene changes to the beach. The Candy Child runs toward the water.]
Candy Child:  Help!
Banana Guard:  [turns around] What? Oh! A scweam!
Candy Child:  Help!
Banana Guard:  Well, now, what seems to be the trouble?
Candy Child:  I saw something in the water! And I was like, "No thanks!"
Starchy:  Out of my way, muffin man!
Banana Guard:  How rude. Well, whatever that little girl saw will be a mystery forever.
[A robotic ship emerges from the water near Susan Strong.]
Ship:  Transport for seeker XJ-7-7 "Strong" has arrived. Please verify identity as "Strong."
Starchy:  [flexing] Oh! Trust me, I'm strong indeed! Pow, pow! Ah? Not enough? You need to feel them guns?
Ship:  Verifying.
Starchy:  [gets scanned] Whoa! Well, hello, frisky! [giggles]
Todd:  Todd, I'm right here!
Ship:  Identifying dangerous mutant. Initiating defensive mode.
[The ship attacks. Splashing and screaming.]
Ship:  Seeking human. Human, come home to safety. Seeking human. Human, come home to safety.
[Scene changes to the Tree Fort. Finn and Jake are trying on funeral clothes.]
Finn:  Hey, Jake, what about this one? [laughs] Great. We're gonna look so great for this funeral.
Jake:  How do you like my bandeau! I was too embarrassed to get a bra fitting. I know they are professionals, but it's just too intimate.
Finn:  You look great!
[Scene changes to the Candy Kingdom under attack by the ship.]
Ship:  Settlement detected. Continuing search for XJ-7-7.
Banana Guards:  Get him! Attack! Attack! Aaah!
Ship:  Hostile cylinders detected. Release countermeasures.
Banana Guard:  [gets foamed] Aah! [muffled] Ahh!
Ship:  Hostile cylinders immobilized. Engaging hostile bobbleheads. [laser sounds] Neutralizing. Please do not turn your system off during neutralization.
[Crash! Finn, Jake, and BMO arrive.]
Starchy:  Holy mud! It took out the gumball guards like they was nothin'!
BMO:  BMO doesn't like it!
Jake:  We gotta chop this thing into smashaghetti.
Finn:  [charging] Yaaaaaaaaaa! I'll take you out with these hug nubs! Yaaaaa!!
Jake:  I'll help you, Finn! [gets hit] Aah!
Finn:  Help me, Jake! [gets grabbed]
Jake:  Oof!
Ship:  Hostile mutant neutralized.
Finn:  [to himself, gulps] You got this, Finn Mertens. You're a buff little bionic baby. Rush! Ruuuuussshhh! Rush! Ruuuussshhh! [grunts, breaks free] Aaahhh!
Ship:  Verifying. Human identified. Infant PG-8-7 "Mertens."
[The ship whooshes around Finn, scanning him.]
Finn:  Aaah -- Oh. [whirring]
Ship:  PG-8-7.
Finn:  Uh...you mean me?
Ship:  You will assist this transport in locating seeker XJ-7-7. PG-8-7 "Mertens," please climb aboard. Please come aboard. Come on.
Finn:  "Mertens?" [Jake smashes the ship]
Jake:  Got it! Great work distractin' 'em, Finn! You okay, dude?
Finn:  I feel like that ship might've been important. But I'm fine.
Jake:  Yeah, my hands are a little sore from smashing, but I'm fine too.
BMO:  Eeeeeeeyaaaa! Ha! Ha! Once again BMO comes out on top! Bzzt!
Jake:  BMO!
Finn:  BMO, you okay?
Ship:  [still functional] Signal received. XJ-7-7 requests transport.
Finn and Jake:  [gasp] Susan!
[Scene changes to a hospital room. Susan is recovering.]
Susan:  Hey. Hi, Finn.
Finn:  Uh, sorry again my grass arm busted you up.
Susan:  It's okay. At the time, Susan was gonna bust you up. Where's Jake? Is he okay?
Finn:  He's outside. He's bringing the ship over.
Susan:  The ship?
Finn:  Oh. Ship.
BMO:  [humming]
Finn:  How about it, Suze? Does any of this look familiar?
Jake:  [enters with ship parts] Me and Finn took this whole bad block down ourselves! Took a bit of fanaglin', but I never hunt what I can't catch.
[Scene changes to Princess Bubblegum's lab. She examines the ship.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Hey. Looking for this? [holds up Susan's implant] I've been holding onto the remnants of your cranial implant since you kidnapped Finn and almost killed Jake. You remember that? I'm running a comparative mass spec test now. [ding!] Yep. Looks like both your implant and the ship have the same technological origin -- human technology.
[Beep]
Princess Bubblegum:  Finished. Looks like BMO's finally downloaded the ship's last commands.
BMO:  [reading] Signal received. Proceed to extraction point. Return Seeker XJ-7-7 and cargo to Founders Island, home.
Princess Bubblegum:  BMO, can you give us print outs?
BMO:  Yes, okay. Printing.
Princess Bubblegum:  [examines map] Hmm. Man, this island's way far out there.
Susan:  Susan needs to go back here. To this island. Not sure why -- Susan having crazy week.
Princess Bubblegum:  I don't know, Susan. It's so far. Even I don't know what's out there. It's a pretty risky solo mission.
Finn:  I'm going too. I mean, we gotta find out where this ship came from. There could be more of them. And if this is human-made, then there might be other humans on that island. That'd be cool to see, right?
Jake:  I'll come too!
BMO:  And so will we.
Neptr:  No, we won't.
BMO:  Oh.
Princess Bubblegum:  Well, it sounds like you're all determined. You should borrow my boat, though. This thing is trashed.
Jake:  We don't need a boat! Have you forgotten -- with a little imagination, I can be anything that you could ever... [loses focus] Oh, I lost focus.
Finn:  Hey, yeah. Can we borrow your boat?
[Scene changes to the Tree Fort roof. Finn finds Fern.]
Finn:  Are you up here, Fern?
Fern:  Hey, thanks for letting me crash on the roof. It's nice up here.
Finn:  Stay as long you want! I came up here to ask a favor. I might be gone for a while on this trip, see, and I need someone to, uh, cover for me here in Ooo.
Fern:  Are you sure? I mean, hero biz is your whole thing, and whatever I am, I'm not you.
Finn:  You can just do your own thing with it. Like... if some huge gross monster's gonna do murder on a buncha innocents, uh, kill it. But kill it you-styles. Just don't go nuts.
Fern:  Okay, I can handle that. Thanks for trusting me.
Finn:  No, thank you, Fern. I better go pack.
Fern:  We should figure out a better thing.
Finn:  Eh. Let's figure out something better.
[Scene changes to Jake video-calling his daughter Charlie.]
Charlie:  Hey, Dad?
Jake:  Charlie! Hi, it's me! It's Dad! I have to go on a sea voyage, honey! Wanted to say bye!
Charlie:  That's cool. Hey, you can't see this shirt, right? This shirt has like four different breakfasts on it.
Jake:  I can't hear anything! Bye, love you! Mwah!
Charlie:  Mmkay, Dad! I'll tell the other pups!
Jake:  And I'm telling the other pups!
[Scene changes to Jake saying goodbye to Lady Rainicorn.]
Jake:  Aww, I'm gonna miss you so much, lady.
Lady Rainicorn:  [speaking Korean]
[Scene changes to the dock. They prepare to leave.]
Jake:  Finn, did you bring your nail clippers?
Finn:  Uh. I think so.
Jake:  Cool, I forgot to.
Finn:  Bye, treehouse!
Neptr:  Goodbye, creator! Now me and BMO can really "cut loose!" Look, BMO! I am pretending to trash a hotel room!
BMO:  [softly] Ouch.
[Scene changes to the dock. Princess Bubblegum and Marceline see them off.]
Finn:  Thanks for seeing us off, guys.
Princess Bubblegum:  Yeah, of course. It's my boat.
Marceline:  And we care about him, you dingus! Come on!
Princess Bubblegum:  Sorry, Marcy is up past her bedtime.
Marceline:  No, it's true. I want you to be really careful out there.
Finn:  Don't worry, we've got Susan --
Marceline:  That's not what I mean. Finn, I get the sense that this trip's more important to you than you're letting on. I mean, if you make it to that island, you might find out some pretty heavy stuff. About the humans and where you came from. About yourself. Alls I'm saying is, you have to promise me -- promise me -- that you'll come home safe.
Finn:  I...
Fern:  [appears] Hi, Bonnie!
Princess Bubblegum and Marceline:  [startled] Ah!
Fern:  I'm Fern. I kind of already know you. I have a lot of fuzzy half-memories from when I was this guy.
Marceline:  Well, just keep the ones where she's our boss, and forget everything else.
Susan:  Finn? Hey, good morning. Boat's loaded, ready to go.
Fern:  [flinches at Susan] Ahh! I flinched! It's cool.
Finn:  We'll be back soon, I promise!
Jake:  Bye, kids! Don't be naughty!
Princess Bubblegum:  Bye! Good luck!
Marceline:  He'll be safe.
Fern:  [to someone offscreen] Hey, aren't you the dude that totaled Starchy's motorcycle?
[The boat leaves. Waves crash as it sails toward the horizon.]
