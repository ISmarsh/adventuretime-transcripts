[The episode begins at the Treehouse. Jake shouts from downstairs.]
Jake:  [shouting] Finn?
Finn:  Yo.
Jake:  Oh, hey. Me and BMO are heading over to the vuvuzela store in the music kingdom. You want to come with? I got to get a new vuvuzela. Somebody keeps smashing my old one.
BMO:  [blows raspberry]
Jake:  [BMO screams] I can't bear this burden any longer! It was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher!
Jake:  BMO, how could you?
Neptr:  No, it was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher.
Jake:  Neptr?!
Finn:  No, I'm the vuvuzela smasher.
Jake:  All right, all right. Well, I'm still getting one. You coming?
Finn:  Nah, me and Fin-- Fern are supposed to clean out the chicken coop today.
Fern:  And if anyone tries to stop me, I'll slash their flipping faces off.
Finn:  True, true.
Jake:  Okay, well, I'll see you later then. Come on, BMO.
BMO:  Jake, I'm sorry! I really am the smasher!
Jake:  Ah, don't sweat it, buddy.

[Outside the Treehouse, Finn watches Fern practice sword moves.]
Fern:  [laughs]
Finn:  Holy cow! Fern, that was perfect! Hyup! You're getting new powers like every day now. Let me see you do Jake -- no, wait, Ice King! Do Ice King!
Fern:  Ha, nah, man. [brrrb!] Imitating uncool people infects you with their loserishness.
Finn:  Oh. Yeah, that rings true. It's too bad you didn't develop any coop-poop-scooping skills. That coop is incredibly disgusting.
Fern:  Actually, about that, I was thinking that, instead, maybe you and I could explore some secret ruins I found.
Finn:  Secret ruins?! Sweet! Maybe we can still catch up with Jake and BMO! Or maybe Neptr could come! Hey, Neptr, you want to go on an adventure, buddy?!
Neptr:  Oh, my glob! Hold on!
Fern:  Actually, I was thinking maybe just you and me would go. Spend some quality time together -- Finn and Fern style.
Finn:  Yeah, okay. That actually even sounds like something Jake would want us to do.
Fern:  [chuckles] Forget it, Neptr!

[Finn and Fern travel through the wilderness toward the ruins.]
Finn:  ♪ Dungeon surprise ♪ Right before my eyes ♪ What a surprise ♪ The dungeon surprise ♪
Finn and Fern:  One, two, three -- shoot! Rock! One, two, three -- shoot! Scissors!
Fern:  [chuckles] This is so weird. I can't tell if it's boring or fun.
Finn:  Well, I can -- it's boring! I want the thrill of victory! Who wants to be the same all the time? Come on, man! You know you love it! Come on! One, two, three...
Fern:  Come on!
Finn:  [sighs]
Finn and Fern:  One, two, three -- shoot. Paper. Rock.
Fern:  What?!
Finn:  Whoa! I won this time.
Fern:  What? But that's not fair!
[Growls]
Fern:  Why is nothing ever fair?
Finn:  Hey, Fern, it's just a game. Don't be so weird.
Fern:  Don't! Don't call me that.
[Inhales sharply]
Fern:  Sorry.
Finn:  Ah, it's okay. That stuff won't mean a thing. I mean, that stuff don't mean a thing. Hey, come on, we're almost there!
Fern:  Whoop, whoop, whoop!
Finn:  Hey, wait up!
Fern:  Whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop! Whoop!

[They arrive at the entrance to the ruins.]
Fern:  Look, we're here!
Finn:  Where? I just see a bunch of rock, swear to glob.
Fern:  But check this out.
Finn:  Whoa! Magic key!
Fern:  I had to chop up a bunch of stubborn so-and-so's to get my hands on this baby.
Finn:  Dang! You been busy. Wow, would you look at that! They hid a ziggurat in the cliff side. Amazing!
Fern:  Yeah, I poked around in there a bit, but --
Finn:  Dut, dut, dut! No spoilers!
Fern:  No, I know. I didn't go past the first level. I was saving it to do together.
Finn:  Sweet.

[Inside the ziggurat, they explore the ancient structure.]
Finn:  Whoa, what is that, a fitness pole?
Fern:  Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya! Come on. This way.
Finn:  Hey, Fern, wait up. Hey, I just want to say that it's really cool that you're into this stuff. You know -- that we have so much in common. It feels almost like we're real brothers, right?
Fern:  Or even closer. I think that's the treasure chamber down there. Why don't you go check it out? I want to study these interesting carvings.
Finn:  Hmm. Fascinating.
Finn:  Oh. Uh, okay. I guess just holler if you need me.
[Sighs]

[Finn enters the treasure chamber and discovers someone has been living there.]
Finn:  Hey, what's this? Contemporary chair, contemporary trash, contemporary meatloaf. Hey, bad news, Fern. It looks like we've got a squatter situation here. I think they got the treasure, but they left some meatloaf behind. The good news is I know a meatloaf dealer--
[Muffled]
Finn:  What the?! Fern?
Finn:  Fern?
[Grunting]
Finn:  Uh, Fern? I think maybe the wind blew the door shut.
Fern:  An "act of nature," I would presume.
Finn:  I'm sorry. I don't actually know how to make meatloaf. That's just a pan of dirt.
Fern:  Well, that's okay. I don't know how to, either!
Finn:  Fern, please open the door.
Fern:  This is where you live now. You'll be fine.
Finn:  What?! Fern, what about Jake and BMO -- my home?
Fern:  It's been your home long enough. It's Fern's turn. I think I'm going to be a really great Finn. Hey, do you know who my favorite is? It's Neptr. I'm a Neptr guy! I'll be back in a month with a new bucket of trash. Later!
Finn:  Fern!?
[Grunts]
Finn:  I've been double-crossed by grass Finn!
Finn:  I don't like being abandoned! I'm sensitive to it!
[Groans]
Finn:  Mmm!
[Sighs]
Finn:  It's too hot!
[Groans]
Finn:  [muttering] There's got to be something useful in here.
[Screams]
Finn:  Oof! You'll be back in a month? With a new bucket of trash? It's hot! There's no air in here! I need air! I need air!
[Whirring]
Finn:  Wha? Oh! A microphone. There's some dried ketchup on it.
Finn:  Uh, hello.
[Beeps]

[A recording from Princess Bubblegum plays from Finn's robot arm.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Hi, Finn! You're still asleep after your fight with Susan. But when you wake up, I'm sure you'll have fun discovering everything your new arm can do. And, Finn, sincerely, thank you for defending our kingdom again. Oh. Someone else wants to thank you, too.
Candy Children:  Thank you, Finn!
Princess Bubblegum:  [laughs] I don't know. Okay, um... Welcome, Finn!
Finn:  Huh. Yes!

[Finn uses his robot arm to escape. A laser cuts through the door.]
[Buzzing]
Finn:  Huh? You donked up!
Fern:  [screams]
Finn:  [brrrb!]
Fern:  How did you get out?
Finn:  [grunts]
Fern:  [growling]
Finn:  Whoa!
Fern:  Hey!
Finn:  [grunting] What do you think you're doing?!
Fern:  I'm weed whacking. You've been Finn long enough! It's my turn.
Finn:  [growls] Fern, smarten up!
Fern:  Nuh-uh!
Finn:  What are you?
Fern:  A weed whacker!
[Hissing]
[Grunting]
Fern:  Nyuh!
Finn:  [hisses]
Fern:  My belzer!
[Grunting]
Finn:  Whoa!
[Panting]
Fern:  [laughs]
Finn:  Fern, if things are going down the way I think they're going down -- please tell Jake I love him.
Fern:  That doesn't matter.
Finn:  I love him!
Fern:  I know you do, Fern. Listen, we can stop this and just go home together. All this lying and fighting, it doesn't have to end like this. Today doesn't have to have this kind of... finality.
Finn:  Fatality!

[Jake arrives at the ruins, opening the door.]
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
Jake:  Hey, boys! Y'all have fun out there?
Finn:  Wait, what happened?
Jake:  I know that look. You just killed someone.
Finn:  [blows horn]

[Scene changes to the Candy Kingdom hospital. Princess Bubblegum treats Finn's injuries.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Almost done, champ. There you go.
Uncle Gumbald:  You looking for an uncle?
