[The episode begins with a stormy night at the Wiz Arts campus. Abracadaniel is seen wiping the school's trophy case.]

Abracadaniel:  [whistling] Well done, Abracadaniel.

[A sudden rumbling occurs, causing everything to shake violently, and one of the trophies cracks the glass of the case]

Abracadaniel:  [gasps] Uh, uh, whoa! Whoa, whoa. Oh. Ohhhhh.

[The rumbling stops]

Abracadaniel:  My poor heart.

[A silhouetted figure with a cart passes by]

Abracadaniel:  [gasps] Who's there? School's closed!

Choose Goose:  [shown with his cart of illegal moisturizer, speaking to an unseen figure] Come closer, I don't bite. Hurry. I don't have all night.

Abracadaniel:  Choose goose?

Choose Goose:  I got the goods! But these babies are banned. So I'mma need more dough than we planned! [smacks lips] That trip made me quite parched, methinks. Why don't you offer me a drink? Hey, why the mysterious silence? I hope you're not planning viole-- [sudden explosion]

Abracadaniel:  Choose Goose! [he sees that only feathers remain] Aaah!

[Thunder crashes; the scene changes to a bus driving through a forest. Peppermint Butler is listening to "Thunderbird" as he is following instructions in a textbook in an attempt to cast a spell.]

Pep:  Utinam barbari...spatium proprium...tuum invadant! [falls over in his seat as the bus stops]

Driver:  I repeat, last stop, Wizwamo Canyon. [Pep gets excited and quickly prepares to get off] This is our last stop, Wizwamo Canyon. Get offa my bus, kid.

Pep:  [runs up to the face of the cliff] Wizards rule! [The cliff disappears, revealing Wizard City. He enters, admiring the sights as he runs by] Yeeaah! Ha ha ha ha!

Con Wizard:  Hey, there!

Pep:  Huh?

Con Wizard:  Yes, hello! I am Song Wizard!

Pep:  Oh, hello! I'm P--

Con Wizard:  Wait! Let me guess!

[He begins to sing "Wizard City" as numerous wizards and creatures display their magical abilities.]

Con Wizard:  [singing] Oh, how the magic flows in the sky...my name's actually Con Wizard. [steals Pep's bookbag] Goodbye.

Pep:  My books! [chases him] Hey! How dare you take advantage of my childlike sense of wonder!

Con Wizard:  Hey, I'll buy you a brew.

Cadebra:  [is floating due to Spader's magic] Whooooaa! [her books fall out of her bag] Aah! My books!

[Spader, Larry, and Blaine laugh]

Spader:  Hey, Cadorka! If you can't even get out of this, how you gonna get into Wiz Arts?

Cadebra:  I've got a few tricks up my sleeve. [she is turned upside down and her magic tricks fall out of her sleeves] Whop!

[Pep and Con Wizard burst out of the brew shop, both trying to get the bookbag]

Pep:  I need these!

Con Wizard:  Ha! [knocks Pep down with the bag, runs off]

Pep:  Ohh!

Con Wizard:  Heh heh heh.

Pep:  [casting a dark spell] Ogdoad, strike down my foe! [Con Wizard's head is chopped off, though he is still alive]

Spader and Larry:  Whoa! [They rush toward the scene, leaving Cadebra to fall]

Blaine:  I'm calling my uncle. [inhales, blows whistle]

Con Wizard:  Hey, kids! Would you like to buy some books?

Wizard Cop #1: Con Wizard!

Con Wizard:  Uh-oh.

Wizard Cop #1: What have you done now?

Con Wizard:  Wh-- I'm the innocent victim here.

Blaine:  It's true! This candy ripped his head off!

Pep:  Uh...he stole my bag.

Con Wizard:  A tissue of lies.

Wizard Cop #2: [picks up Con Wizard's head] Ah, the sweet smell of justice. [sniffs] Ugh! That's not justice. It smells vaguely like...dark magic.

[All gasp]

Wizard Cop #1: Y'all kids know that's illegal, right?

[Spader, Larry, and Blaine all nod, then Pep does the same]

Wizard Cop #1: We'll let you off with a warning this time, young candy. But any more of that biz will land your minty little butt straight in the wiz priz.

Wizard Cop #2: And you'll bunk with real jerks, like this thief.

Con Wizard:  I'm not a thief. [his body grabs his head] I'm an artist. [runs off]

Wizard Cop #1 and #2: [chase after him] Hey, get back here!

Pep:  My textbooks.

Spader:  Hey, that was some pretty sick magic, candy boy. You're tryin' for Wiz Arts, right? Walk with us.

Larry:  We're walkin'.

Pep:  [gasps]

[Cadebra recollects her books and notices that Pep took one]

Spader:  I'm Spader, by the way. This is my cousin Larry.

Larry:  Hello.

Spader:  And that snitch over there is Blaine.

Blaine:  I had to! I got responsibilities!

Spader:  Pssh. So what's your name, little head-ripper?

Pep:  I'm Peppermint Bu-- You can call me Pep.

Spader:  Wait. Are you related to...

Spader, Larry, and Blaine: Peppermint Butler?

Larry:  The dark one. The Lord of chaos.

Blaine:  I heard he got banned from Wizard City for stealing forbidden magics. [An imaginary Peppermint Butler appears in the background, and causes the buildings surrounding him to crumble] And then he destroyed Wizard City.

Larry:  I heard he started the great gum wars and was killed by Golb. [The Peppermint Butler explodes with GOLB's hands behind him, then the imaginary scene ends]

Spader:  That's all rumors. But he's definitely a dark wizard.

Pep:  [nervously] Ha ha. What?! I'm not related to that...sicko.

Spader:  Cool.

[Clock chiming]

Larry:  [gasps] The auditions. We'll be late.

Spader:  Right, let's go.

[All of them start heading up to Wiz Arts]

Pep:  Finally.

[Cadebra is seen following along with her deck of cards]

Larry:  [pointing] Entrance auditions are this way.

Spader:  Calm down, Larry, dang.

Pep:  There's the salamander dormitories. And over there's... I don't know what that is. [gasps as he sees the Wizard Police investigating the area where Choose Goose exploded] What do you think happened here?

Spader:  Ripper, I'm not here to solve mysteries. I'm here to shine. [transition to the auditions, where he performs an incredible spell to light up a candle]

Audience:  Whoa. Ahhhhh.

[Spader puts the candle out]

Pep:  That's my new best friend.

Brain Wizard:  Oh, boy. What a treat. By the power of headmaster vested in me, we hereby bestow unto thee the rank...of salamander.

[A badge with an S appears on Spader's jacket, and his school uniform wraps around him]

Audience:  [applause]

Brain Wizard:  What a cool child. I feel bad for whoever's next. And that is...Cadebra.

Cadebra:  [throws smoke bomb] Ha! [runs up to the stage, panting] Hoo-yeah. Do not attempt this at home. It might end in a... [pulls out a magician hat] hat-tastrophe. [puts the hat over the candle, switches it with an electronic one] Hocus pocus feel-ee-okus. [reveals the lit up electronic candle] Voilà. Just a little light entertainment.

Brain Wizard:  Young lady, where is the real candle?

Cadebra:  [pulls the real candle out from behind Brain Wizard's head] Looking for this?

Brain Wizard:  What nerve. Ordinarily you'd be dismissed for such a disgusting fakery, but as you are related to our well-loved groundskeeper, you'll be allowed to stay.

[Cadebra receives her badge and school uniform]

Cadebra:  Nice.

Brain Wizard:  Next up, Magic Felicia.

[Cadebra walks offstage and passes by the audience, she hears laughter]

Student:  That was embarrassing to watch.

Abracadaniel:  Psst! Psst! Deb! [puts hand on her shoulder] Hey, they only laugh because you're different.

Cadebra:  I know.

Abracadaniel:  So stop being different.

Cadebra:  But I love stage magic.

Abracadaniel:  Ah, just use real magic.

Cadebra:  But where's the fun in that? [summons a flame in her hand, extinguishes it] Where's the pizzazz?

Abracadaniel:  Ugh, you're gonna keep being different, aren't you? Then you're gonna get kicked out. And -- and...

Cadebra:  [grabs his hand and walks off with him] Come on, let's go calm you down with some hot cocoa, okay?

Pep:  Don't be like that trainwreck.

Brain Wizard:  Next up -- Pepper Mint.

Pep:  Rock 'n' roll. [walks up to the stage] I shall now summon an infernal flame directly from the nightosphere.

Spader:  Hard core.

Pep:  [draws a Phil face, then reads the spell from a book] Utinam barbari spatium...pro-- prium tuum, uh, invadant. [a single flame appears]

Audience:  Ooooooh.

Pep:  [clears throat] Flame of night, I command thee. Light the candle!

[A skull appears in the flame, and growls]

Pep:  Aah! [it begins to chase him] Ah! I command thee.

Skull:  [growling]

Pep:  No-o-o-o!

[The skull leaps at him, but is stabbed by a sword thrown by Weapon Head the Third. Most of the stage is on fire, then the candle lights up.]

Pep:  Ta-da.

Audience:  [laughter]

Weapon Head:  We can't let this kid in. He'd ruin our rep.

Dr. Caledonius:  I think this child shows great potential. He deserves a chance to learn how to channel it.

Weapon Head:  I'm pretty sure he's just trash candy.

Ron James:  Do I have to teach him?

Brain Wizard:  Hmm, perhaps Cal has a point.

Weapon Head:  Ugh...

Dr. Caledonius:  Pepper Mint. Please accept this badge.

[Pep receives his uniform and badge]

Pep:  Yes! Spader. Hey, Spader. Looks like we're gonna be roomies.

Spader:  That's a skink, bro.

Pep:  What?

Spader:  You can't tell a salamander from a skink?

[Zoom in on both badges, and there is a clear difference between the two]

Pep:  Uh...

Spader:  He's no ripper. He's a rip-off.

[Larry and Blaine laugh]

Pep:  [stomach rumbles] Wh--

Spader:  What's the matter? You gonna blorf?

[Pep runs off to the skinks building, where an apparition of the original Peppermint Butler emerges from his mouth]

Pep:  Blaahhh!

Peppermint Butler Apparition:  A flame from the nightosphere? That's basic flippin' baby magic.

Pep:  I'm sorry.

Peppermint Butler Apparition:  And a skink? Seriously?!

Pep:  I can do better. I will do better.

Cadebra:  Skinks aren't that bad. [the apparition turns to her with a scowl, she screams; it then goes back inside of Pep] Was that...Peppermint Butler?

Pep:  Uh, no.

Cadebra:  It was. I'll go get Brain Wizard.

Pep:  Wait! That wasn't really Peppermint Butler. It was only, uh...a curse?

Cadebra:  A curse? Who would curse you?

[Pep has a flashback to when he had cursed himself to be embodied by his ambition to become a powerful dark wizard]

Peppermint Butler:  I hereby instill my intensest intention to strive for the dark arts' accomplished ascension. [transition to when he became an infant due to the dum-dum juice] Regardless of old lady fate's intervention.

Princess Bubblegum:  [offscreen] He's been doused with Gumbald's dum-dum juice. [the flashback ends, her voice fading] He's gotta start all over.

Pep:  It's not dangerous. It's just to make sure I become a powerful wizard again. I mean for the first time. Ever. I'm a baby. Peppermint Butler...is my...uh...

Cadebra:  Your...uncle. And he's really judgmental and embarrassed, right? Just like mine. I guess we have a lot in common.

Pep:  Just don't tell anyone, okay?

Cadebra:  Skink secret. Zip.

Pep:  And don't call me skink. I'm getting out of this weak level first thing tomorrow. [covers himself under a blanket]

Cadebra:  Wow, you really need a friend.

Pep:  No.

Cadebra:  I'll be your friend.

Pep:  No.

Cadebra:  We're two toasts in a toaster.

Bufo:  The signs speak to me. And now...finally...the quest for the chalice begins. [laughing evilly, coughing; Choose Goose is seen featherless in a jar]

[Transition to the next day]

Pep:  [walking to class] Yesterday was just a fluke. Today's a new day. And the first step on my road to wizardly greatness -- Transmutation 101.

Blaine:  Can you believe that Peppermint kid yesterday thought he was a salamander?

Larry:  Yes.

Pep:  Hello, gang.

Spader:  Ugh.

Pep:  Mind if I --

Bufo:  No, no, no. Not in my class. Nuh-uh. [pointing] Skinks in the nosebleed section.

[Cadebra waves goofily to Pep from the back]

Pep:  Oh, poop.

[Spader, Larry, and Blaine laugh]

Pep:  [Cadebra gives a peace sign, he is unamused] Hmm. [cleans a cobweb near his seat and sits down]

Cadebra:  [slides over to him] Hey, roomie. Don't we have the best view from here?

Pep:  Not for long. Once I really show 'em my stuff, they'll up me to salamander.

Cadebra:  [notices the book Pep is holding] Say. This book looks just like the one I lost. Same exact stickers and everything.

Pep:  Yeah, but it's not.

Cadebra:  Whatever you say, P-Man.

Bufo:  Quiet. Quiet. Stop your Walla. [clears throat, the tadpoles come out and yell] Sit down and zip your hams! [the students turn their attention to him, with one falling from the ceiling; goes back to the frog host] Right off the bat, let's get the rumors out of the way. Yes, I used to be a dark wizard. Many say the greatest dark wizard. Did I swim deep in the loomy gloom? Yes. Did I transcend the eight schools of magic? Yep. Did I throw Laser Wizard and Forest Wizard under the bus to buy my own freedom? Ehh. That's all in the past. And I'm not gonna talk about it. Okay, you know what? Let's talk about it.

Larry:  Hey! We're here to learn some real wizardry, not hear your sad backstory. [Bufo turns him into a rock]

Bufo:  How do you like me now, Larry? Lesson one -- [holding up an egg carton] eggs.

Pep:  Eggs?

Bufo:  Eggs are especially susceptible to transmutation. [casts spell on an egg] Razza mafoo.

'Bufo's Egg: Bufo!

Bufo':  Hey, look at that. Nature is giving you a head start, so I expect you to have magicked up something really special by the next class. [his egg walks across the table, and falls when he slams the table] That includes you, Larry! I didn't buy enough eggs, so everyone has to pair off with the person next to you. [gives each pair their eggs] Open to page 6 in your textbook -- "The Primary Elements of Transmutation."

Pep:  [raising his hand] Can I get another partner?

Bufo:  [the tadpoles emerge and he smacks his hand down] No!

Cadebra:  Watch this.

Pep:  Hey.

[Cadebra shoves the egg into her ear]

Pep:  Aah!

Cadebra:  Blup. [she shows off the egg on her tongue] Ta-da! Blllllbb.

Pep:  Okay. This is a fluke, too. I'll crush my other classes.

[The next class on his schedule is Enchantment with the Life-Giving Magus]

Life-Giving Magus:  [viewing the students' progress] Ahh! Wonderful.

Pep:  [casting a spell to animate a hot dog; Cadebra is playing with a sock puppet instead] Oscario mayerium botulus animus. [the hot dog moves a little]

Life-Giving Magus:  [sees Spader dancing in sync with an animated coat rack] Hot dog! I am losing my mind at this choreography.

[Pep is disappointed and stops moving the hot dog. The next class is Astral Projection with Berdzerd]

Students:  Tai-re-re-re, tai-re-re-re

[A few of the students manage to successfully project themselves]

Students:  Whee! Whoooaaa! [others continue chanting] Tai-re-re-re [Spader and Blaine high five]

Pep:  Tai-r--  [starts gagging as the apparition emerges]

Peppermint Butler Apparition:  You bungler. [is shoved back in by Pep]

[The next class is Transfiguration with Brain Wizard]

Blaine:  [makes his head look like Spader's] Mm. [starts making a kissy face, Spader pushes him away] Ack.

Spader:  Pretty good. [Blaine is touched by his words]

Pep:  [straining hard as he tries to change his appearance, while Cadebra is making faces]

[Next class is Divination with Dimension Wizard and Little Dude]

Dimension Wizard:  This locator spell requires a strong emotional bond. So team up with your bestie.

Little Dude:  [comes out from behind Dimension Wizard's head] Found him.

Dimension Wizard:  Got that right, little dude. [Spader is shown casting the spell] Think of your buddy... and the light will lead you right to them.

Blaine:  [Spader's spell goes to Larry the rock instead of him] Really?

Pep:  [manages to cast the spell] Huh! [it disappears] Yaaahhh! [pulls on his eyelids and mumbles in frustration]

[Cadebra is looking through a deck of fortune-telling cards, she is surprised to see one with a man stabbed several times in the back]

Dimension Wizard:  [pointing to Pep] Your bond is weak!

Little Dude:  Be better at having friends.

Dimension Wizard:  [jumps away] He-yo!

[Pep sits there with a blank expression. He and the others then go to lunch.]

Pep:  [carrying a tray, he sees Spader and his friends nearby, Bufo bumps into him] Uhh! Hey, jerk. Watch where you're --

Bufo:  [notices Pep and croaks in annoyance]

Cadebra:  [eating with Abracadaniel at a table] Num-num-num. What's going on, Abracaduncle?

Abracadaniel:  I'm in big trouble, Cadebs. Someone smashed the trophy case and stole one of the school cups. [flashback to the broken glass and missing cup] And of course I'm gonna get blamed for it. [end of flashback; sighs] I need this job, and I'm, like, your only friend here. [sees Pep sit at the table and put on a napkin] Guess that's my cue to leave.

Cadebra:  Okay, bye. [continues eating noisily]

Pep:  Aarggh! Why is this so hard?!

Cadebra:  Huh? It's just lunch. Chill, man.

Pep:  Tsk-tsk. This simply won't do. [realigns Cadebra's back] How am I supposed to achieve greatness with everyone against me? [puts a napkin on Cadebra and starts sweeping up the crumbs] It's like they want me to fail.

Cadebra:  Well, I'm not against you. [she smiles, showing the food in her teeth] Hehehehe.

[Next class is Potions with Ron James]

Ron James:  Potion recipes are mad secret, y'all, [takes Pep's brew and puts it in a machine] but this baby here can reverse-engineer any concoction back to its alchemical component. [the coffee is reverted into a rat skeleton and tree branches] Shwazaa!

[The next class is Conjuration with Weapon Head]

Weapon Head:  [summons a sword and a shield] Weapons! [she hits the shield with the sword]

[The next class is Magic History with Dr. Caledonius. The students are waiting outside of her room]

Student:  Huh. This is magic history, right? With Dr. Caledonius?

Dr. Caledonius:  [running up to them] Aaaaaaahhhh! What are you waiting for, kids? History is happening all around us. Follow me.

Pep:  Dr. Caledonius?

Dr. Caledonius:  Call me Dr. C. Look. Fossil evidence of our great wizard past. [points toward the fossilized remains of a magical elephant creature]

All:  Oooooh.

Dr. Caledonius:  [panting] Ahh! Now, this column dates back to a time when an order of dark wizards took over the school and turned it into a temple dedicated to the worship of...of...Well, we really don't know who. History is full of mysteries. And on your left, you'll see a real piece of ancient history.

Bufo:  [about to clean graffiti that is making fun of him] Hmm. What?

Dr. Caledonius:  Just messin', Bufo. [winks, chuckles]

Bufo:  [backs away, blushing] Really. This is hardly proper...madame.

Pep:  [chuckles]

Dr. Caledonius:  [whispers] He's the worst. [normal voice] This way to more learning. [trips over something in the ground] Oof. [pulls out an ancient tool] Whatever could this be? Oh, my. Who can tell me what this beauty was used for? Anyone? [Pep and Spader raise their hands, and she picks Pep] You there. Mr. Mint. [Spader is surprised]

Pep:  Oh. H-Harvesting mistletoe? [Spader and Blaine look at each other, annoyed]

Dr. Caledonius:  Very good, Star Brite. Now this is the kind of zester for yester I love to see. [gasps] Whaddaya say we excavate this old courtyard together? It's history you can touch with your hands. Come on, dig in.

[All of the students talk excitedly as they dig for more artifacts. A hooded figure stands by, sipping his coffee as he watches them.]

[Transition to the brew shop at night, where a band is playing "Dark Dark Dark"]

Mushroom Wizard:  [playing wizard chess with another wizard] Wizard check. [the other wizard beats him]  Wizard whaaaaat?

[Indistinct conversations are heard]

Pep:  [Cadebra starts spinning their egg, he stops her] Quit it! This is my homework. And I intend to ace it.

Potable Wizard:  Hey! That's not your order, dingus!

Bufo:  I know. I just got tired of waiting. The lack of respect I get around here is unbelievable. These people.

Cadebra:  Hmm. You know, this egg is just like you, Pep -- covered in a hard white shell. But the inside is all gooey, ready to change into something beautiful.

Pep:  Hmm. Chromagy. Ugh. No. A chroma spell is too basic. A chroma spell is too basic. It's gotta be more powerful. Ah, perfect. Ogrification.

Cadebra:  Should we really be skipping that far ahead?

Pep:  To be powerful, I have to cast the most powerful spell. Kalum vas xen corpus. Relum xen bran bal in vas! [growls] Why didn't it work?! [bangs his head against the table] Aaah!

Cadebra:  Hey, Pep...[takes out three cups and puts the egg under one, then switches them around]...where's the egg? [Pep points at what would be the correct cup, she imitates an incorrect buzzer and reveals it is not there]

Pep:  Huh? [he lifts up the other two cups, and is surprised to see it is not under them either] Gra! Give it.

Cadebra:  Pep, sometimes you just gotta stick with the classics. [takes out her book and opens it, revealing the egg, laughs] Do this one. Don't think. Just do it.

Pep:  Enfo cor cantis...chromeo! [the egg develops a colorful pattern]

Cadebra:  You did it, Pep.

Pep:  Hehe. Yeah. And you didn't ruin anything.

Cadebra:  Nope.

[The door bell rings as Spader and Blaine enter]

Pep:  Spader.

Bufo:  Hmm.

Cadebra:  Hm.

Blaine:  Gotta go work the pipes. [heads to the bathroom]

Spader:  Gross.

Potable Wizard:  Hey, Spader, my friend. The usual?

Spader:  You really get me, Potable Wizard. [he overhears Cadebra's laughter]

Pep:  I hope Bufo likes the egg.

Cadebra:  That ol' croaker's gonna love it.

Spader:  [in pretend shock] Dude. You gotta tell me how you did that.

Pep:  Oh. Sure, Spader. I could give you a play-by-play and --

Spader:  Yeah, all I could manage was a seraphication spell.

'Spader's Egg': [vocalizing]

Pep:  [gasps] It's...amazing.

Cadebra:  Our egg is nice, too.

'Spader's Egg': [singing] Nope [fires a lightning bolt at Pep and Cadebra's egg, causing it to splat on Pep's face]

Spader:  Oh, whoopsies.

Pep:  You -- You did that on purpose.

Spader:  Your egg sucked anyway. [puts a napkin on his head] Here, clean yourself up.

[Pep creates a fist in anger, the rumbling from earlier occurs again]

Wizard:  Whoa.

Grass Head Wizard:  What's happening?

Wizard:  Another oooquake?

Bufo:  Huh! Coconteppi! Oh, it's time. No one pay me any mind. [clicks tongue, he leaves]

Pep:  Spader! I'm warning you, if you don't back off -- [stomach gurgles, he looks like he is about to vomit as he rushes to the bathroom]

Cadebra:  Pep.

Potable Wizard:  Skim pigeon milk, two pumps of the good stuff for Spa-a-a-der.

Spader:  He-e-e-y.

[The bathroom door closes, Pep brings up a trash can to reach the sink, and the apparition emerges again]

Pep:  Aah!

Peppermint Butler Apparition:  You absolute loser. You think you're going to become me by slinging some baby egg spells?

Pep:  B-But it went fine until Spader ruined --

Peppermint Butler Apparition:  Bull stuff. He's got your number. If you don't fix this, that golden boy's gonna eat our lunch all year. So get out there and show him you...mean...business!

Pep:  [gulps, coughs up some of the curse's essence, then punches the mirror] Hyah! [panting] Spader!! [he slams the door open as he leaves]

Blaine:  [comes out from a nearby stall, having heard everything] Holy cow.

'Spader's Egg': [singing] Spader, you're so flipping cool

Spader:  This tastes terrible. Pfbt. Shoot. I forgot Larry. Eh.

[Footsteps approaching]

Aah!

[Splat!]

Cadebra:  Fire. Fire.

Momdebra:  Cadebra, focus. If you don't raise your stats by 27.82578950%, you'll never be a salamander and you'll end up being a joke, like your uncle here.

Abracadaniel:  Listen to your mom. I'm not even a good joke.

Momdebra:  Don't you want to be a powerful wizard?

Cadebra:  Nah, not really.

Abracadaniel and Momdebra:  Whaaa?

Cadebra:  Being a wizard is boring. I want to have fun! Fun!!

Momdebra:  Cadebra! Turn around when I scream your name like this! If I get high pitched like this...

Cadebra:  Huh?

Momdebra:  ...you have to turn around immediately!

Cadebra:  "Magic Tricks &amp; Fake Stage Illusions"? Whoa. This looks so...so...fun! It's the perfect mix of glamour and cool that I've been craving.

[Cheers and applause]

Cadebra:  Ha-ha! [smacks lips] Pep, did I ever tell you how I got into --

[Indistinct conversations]

Cadebra:  Hey. There's my buddy. You look pretty haggard. Like you were up all night killing a guy.

Pep:  I was up all night saving our bacon.

Cadebra:  Our egg. How'd you fix it?

[Hisses, growls]

Pep:  Watch out! It's a little... unstable.

Cadebra:  Unstable? Wait. Did you use...dark magic?

Pep:  Be cool. Just a dash. Just don't touch it or breathe on it or look at it.

Blaine:  Larry, have you seen Spader? [Larry does not respond as he is still a rock] He never came back last night. Yeah, that's not like him.

Pep:  Stop, stop, stop.

Blaine:  Peppermint.

[Whistles]

Bufo:  Before we review your eggs, I've got an important announcement regarding your fellow student, Spader Petersen.

Students:  Spader? They're talking about Spader? He said Spader.

Bufo:  This morning, I received this letter from him. [clears throat] "Dear Bufo, up until now, my life has been like a rubber bone...[transitions to Spader's voice]

Spader:  ...that I've been chewing with sad puppy teeth when it should have been...a bone bone that I'm shredding with my wolf fangs. So I'm giving up magic to walk the wilderness of the world and find the delicious marrow it has to offer. Farewell, my favorite teach. Love --"

Blaine:  No! That can't be true! Spader loves magic and hates metaphors!

Bufo:  Well, you know, some kids just don't have the grit to navigate the murky magical waters. What do you want me to say?

[Sniffles]

N-- Huh?

Pep:  No! Spader! [blows nose] Why?!

Bufo:  Mr. Peppermint. Since you're making such a racket, perhaps you'd like to share your assignment first.

Whoa! [sniffles]

Pep's Egg:  I am the nutritious shadow that looms over your breakfast.

Wha--

Did you see that?

Bufo:  Hmm. This is unexpectedly...

Pep's Egg:  Hyup.

Bufo:  ...interesting.

He's the new Spader.

He totally is.

All:  Peppermint Spader! Peppermint Spader!

Blaine:  No! Original-flavor Spader!

Bufo:  Mr. Mint, take Spader's old seat.

Blaine:  No-o-o-o-o-o-o. What did you do to him?!

Pep:  Huh?

Blaine:  I heard you last night, talking to yourself, making threats. You were gonna show Spader you...meant...business.

Pep:  That? That was just angry talk. Yes, he was tough on me, but that made me a better wizard. I mean, look how great my egg turned out.

Pep's Egg:  I grow too large for this soufflé you call space-time!

Pep:  Uh-oh.

Pep's Egg:  Aah! Coconteppi!

[Winces]

Bufo:  Back of the class.

Blblb!

Cadebra:  Pep! Let me help you.

Blaine:  You're hiding something, and I'm gonna find out what it is. My uncle's a cop!

Bufo:  No one likes a rat.

[Chirping]

[Indistinct conversations]

[sighs] I wish I could just disappear.

[Coughing]

Cadebra:  [whispers] You're supposed to run away.

Pep:  I'm serious. I've gotta get Blaine off my case or everyone will find out about me.

[Normal voice]

Cadebra:  So your uncle's a dark wizard. It doesn't mean you did anything to Spader.

Pep:  But if something did happen to him, there could be, like, guilt by association. Aah!

Cadebra:  Then let's find Spader and set this straight.

Pep:  Pshh. He's too far away by now.

Cadebra:  Friend, we're in wizard school. We're gonna do a location spell to find Spader.

Pep:  You don't even like real magic.

Cadebra:  Hockaronda Crockpot. We'll boost the spell's range by doing it together.

Pep:  Ugh. Fine. It's never gonna work, though.

Cadebra:  Shush.

Pep:  Ahh.

Cadebra:  Look, Pep.

We're doing it.

Pep:  Huh? What does it mean?

Ahh!

[Groans]

Cadebra:  So close. We just gotta sync our waves more.

Pep:  There is no "we." I'm nothing like you.

[Thunder crashes]

[Thunder rumbles]

Heh-heh. Coast is clear, Larry.

[Chuckles]

Pep:  Stupid Cadebra. It's all her fault. Ahhh.

It's like you're trying to screw up.

Please, I'm in a lot of trouble.

Peppermint Butler Apparition:  Throw them off your trail. Even if you have to lie, cheat, and steal.

Pep:  Stop yelling at me.

Peppermint Butler Apparition:  I'm encouraging you. Look out.

Ooh.

Dr:  Caledonius: Oh! Whuuhhh... Whoa! Oh, no.

Dr. Caledonius. Are you okay?

Oh, Pep. Sorry about that.

Pep:  No, I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm a screw-up. A bona fide ding-dong.

Dr. Caledonius:  Oh, ease up. That's my favorite student you're talking about.

Oh.

Come on. Give me a hand, will ya?

Pep:  Whoa. That hole got hecka deep, huh?

Mm-hmm.

Pep:  Wait. What are we doing out here?

Oh. You caught me. I bury these artifacts in this courtyard so there are enough sweet finds to go around the next day. I just want all my students to have a good time. Not to feel left out, you know?

That's nice.

You can keep a secret, can't you?

Pep:  Yeah. Glob knows I've got a ton of 'em.

Dr. Caledonius:  Is that why you were out wandering tonight? Mm. I see...

Dr. Caledonius:  Well, come on down here and help out. Get out of your head for a while.

Pep:  [sighs] I'd probably just mess that up, too.

Dr. Caledonius:  Oh, Star Brite.

Pep:  Do you ever feel like...no matter how hard you try,you're still nothing but a disappointment... and everyone -- even your mentors -- want you to fail?

Dr. Caledonius:  Hold on. Is this about Bufo?

Pep:  Bufo?

Dr. Caledonius:  Psh. That jerk's always pushing people around because of his "dark wizard past."

Pep:  Dark wizard past?

Dr. Caledonius:  Don't let that washed-up jabroni make you doubt yourself, Pep. You were meant for greatness.

Pep:  You're right.

Dr. Caledonius:  Hmm? W-Wait. Where are you going?

[Thunder crashes]

Pep:  Hmm...unlock! Bufo used to be a dark wizard. He's the perfect patsy. And this'll make him look even more suspicious than me. He was there at the brew last night. He hates all his students. He's even the one who got the letter from -- the letter from Spader. I mean, why would he send it to Bufo?

[Hisses]

Pep:  Ha, perfect. Guilt by association. Wait a minute. Did Bufo kill Spader? Ah! Huh? Bufo! I'm right, aren't I? What did you do to Spader? Why are you sitting in the dark drinking out of a fancy cup? Talk.  Waa!

[Whistle blows in distance]

Fingerprints.

Wizard Cop:  Blaine, I'm right here.

Blaine:  Busted.

Pep:  Goo-goo ga-ga?

Blaine:  I told you, Uncle J. Who else could leave such dainty little tracks?

Pep:  Oof, forgot to wipe.

Blaine:  know your secret. Peppermint Butler.

Pep:  Why did I bring that?

Blaine:  Cuff him, Larry.

[Whimpers]

Wizard Cop #1: You have been identified as Peppermint Butler, a dark wizard permabanned from Wizard City. You're also a person of interest in the disappearance of one Spader Petersen.

Blaine:  You killed my boy.

Pep:  I-I didn't kill anybody. Not Spader or Bufo.

Wizard Cop #1: That's Bufo? You're a real maniac.

Blaine:  Keep back. Dark wizard. Dark wizard coming through. Pay no attention to the dark wizard.

Wizard Cop #1: Keep a wide berth.

Cadebra:  I'm gonna head back. Pep's probably cooled down by now.

Abracadaniel:  I don't think I like him.

Cadebra:  He's prickly, but he really needs my help, you know?

Abracadaniel:  Uh...I'm always here for you, Deb.

Wizard Cop #1: Dark wizard.

Abracadaniel:  Aaaaah!

Pep:  Cadebra, help!

Cadebra:  Pep. Pep.

Blaine:  Nuh-uh.

Cadebra:  I knew you needed me.

Wizard Cop #1: Stay back, little girl. This is the nefarious Peppermint Butler.

Cadebra:  Whoa, whoa, whoa. This harmless little cherub isn't the Peppermint Butler. He's just his underdog nephew. Right, Pep? Pep?

Pep:  Mm.

Cadebra:  [gasps]

Pep:  Cadebra?

Nah!

Hey.

Blaine:  Fake magic. Gross. Wh-Where'd he go? [blows whistle]

[Indistinct speaking]

Blaine:  Listen up, everyone. The nerd loser skink formerly known as Peppermint is in fact Peppermint Butler.

[All gasp, chatter]

Blaine:  But my uncle's gonna get him and anyone who's helping him.

[Indistinct shouting]

Dr. Caledonius:  How are you holding up?

Cadebra:  Real bad, if I'm honest. I thought he was my friend, ya know?

Dr. Caledonius:  Do you think he actually dispatched Bufo and Spader?

Cadebra:  No. Pep can be kind of a jerk, but he wouldn't kill anyone. I can feel that in my bones.

Dr. Caledonius:  Ha. I agree with you. Even the ill-famed Peppermint Butler deserves a second chance. But first I have to find him.

Cadebra:  Did you try a locator spell?

Dr. Caledonius:  I did, but...our connection isn't strong enough. I just hope I can find Pep before the wiz cops blast him on sight.

Abracadaniel:  Were you guys talking about me?

Pep:  Lick me out of existence, boys. Huh? Ahh!

Cadebra:  We do have a connection.

Pep:  You cast that spell? Great. Oof.

Cadebra:  You could've just told me you were trying to escape your dark past.

Pep:  I wasn't trying to escape it. I was trying to recreate it.

Oh, no!

Cadebra:  Look, we'll find the real killer and prove you're not a big scary dark wizard anymore.

Pep:  But I wanna be.

Cadebra:  Think back -- Did you see anything suspicious at the crime scene?

Pep:  Oh, yeah. Bufo was holding this fancy cup when I found him. Oop.

Ant:  Sweet.

Pep and Cadebra:  Aahhh!

Cadebra:  Did that stuff blow up Bufo? We should take this to Ron James's alchemy machine and see what's in it.

Dr. Caledonius:  [gasps] Cadebra. Did you find Pep?

Pep:  Who?

Dr. Caledonius:  [laughs] Star Brite.

Aah!

Dr. Caledonius:  Wait, don't run. [snaps fingers]

Oof!

Cadebra:  Dr. C, we think the goop in here killed Bufo.

Dr. Caledonius:  Oh, my stars. The Chalice of Coconteppi.

Cadebra:  Uh, what's Coconteppi?

Dr. Caledonius:  A very old and powerful relic. Once we return it to its rightful place, everything will be alright.

Blaine:  Gotcha. Stop right there, criminal scum. [inhales sharply, blows whistle]

[Thud]

Dr. Caledonius:  They'll be fine. Hurry.

We're almost there.

Whoa.

Wha--

Gross.

Dr. Caledonius:  Star Brite, return the Chalice to the throne. It's got a cupholder and everything.

Eesh.

Is that Coconteppi?

Oh, don't mind that. It's been there for thousands of years.

Hmm. Hold up.

Yeah, boy!

What's happening?

Dr. Caledonius:  The Chalice is in its rightful place.

Coconteppi, Coconteppi, Coconteppi, Coconteppi...

[Chanting] Coconteppi, Coconteppi,

Dr. C, look out!

Coconteppi.

Dr. Caledonius:  It's alright. Everything is as it should be.

Cadebra:  Pep, let's get outta here.

Brain Wizard:  What's the matter, Cadebra? Don't you trust...our teachers?

Potable Wizard:  My presence is also surprising.

Together:  Coconteppi, Coconteppi...

Dr. Caledonius:  Don't you realize you're witnessing history? We're standing in the true heart of Wizard City -- the tomb of Coconteppi.

Coconteppi, Coconteppi, Coconteppi, Coconteppi...

Dr. Caledonius:  Millions of years ago, the usurpers of Wizard City hid his body away to deny and suppress the darkness that had been magic's original power. Our secret order of wizards have been searching for centuries. For even death could not contain his power forever. The ichor was diluted upon discovery.

Abracadaniel:  Choose goose!

Dr. Caledonius:  But the source was finally located, right under our noses.

Ahh!

Our first attempt...was a failure.

Ugh! Is that why you killed Bufo? Because he picked the wrong sacrifice?

Dr. Caledonius:  Bufo was a deluded old toad. He tried to use the ichor for himself.

Bufo:  [the tadpoles are in a plastic bag] It should have worked. We were so young and moist-skinned.

Dr. Caledonius:  Fool. The Chalice of Coconteppi requires potential far surpassing your own. Yes, Peppermint Butler. You are the Chalice.

Cadebra:  What? Then what's this?

Dr. Caledonius:  Just a cool cup.

Bufo:  Gotta have the cup.

Dr. Caledonius:  Surpass your old self. Become the most powerful wizard of us all.

Pep:  That is why I came here.

Cadebra:  Come on!

Pep:  Eh, I'll risk it.

Cadebra:  Dude, even if you survive, that much undiluted D-magic will mess you up. You won't be little Peppermint anymore.

Pep:  Being me hasn't worked out so good.

Cadebra:  Baloney. You can be powerful in your own way. It's a long road, and it'll be way harder...like stupid hard...but you'll own it.

Dr. Caledonius:  Get rid of her.

Cadebra:  Ah!

[Laughter]

Bufo:  Wait. Give her to us.

Potable Wizard:  Mm, boba straw.

Ahh! Pep!

Oh, hold her still.

I'm trying.

Dr. Caledonius:  Ignore that. Become who you were meant to be.

Peppermint Butler:  What are you waiting for?

[Groaning]

Drink the ichor.

Cadebra:  Pep!

Cadebra?

Peppermint Butler:  You're not good enough. You need that sweet ichor.

I do.

[Screams]

Hng!

Yes. Dark one.

[Babbling]

[Roars]

Dr. Caledonius:  See, Twigs? I was right. Oh, glorious Pepperminteppi, lay waste to the oppressive city above. Usher in the second age of terror.

Potable Wizard:  Ooh, that's too hot.

Dimension Wizard:  Dimension punch!

Cadebra:  Stop. Stop it. Pep, can we go now?

Dr. Caledonius:  Don't fight the dark ichor. Embrace it.

Pep:  Run, Cadebra.

Dr. Caledonius:  [laughs] Yes. More weight. Oh!

[Explosion]

It's me.

[Roaring]

[Panting]

[Grunting]

Cadebra:  Pep, I know you're still in there. Fire, fire, fire. He's gonna splat me and he won't even realize it. No. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die in style. [vocalizing] Oh, yeah. Do not attempt this at home.

Pep:  You're no wizard.

Cadebra:  Wait. We're still best buds.

Pep:  Hmph. Is this supposed to show me that the fragility of life is worth preserving? Pathetic.

Cadebra:  No, it's to distract you.

Pep:  Huh? Ack!

Cadebra:  Hocus pocus. [grunts]

Ahhhh!

Pep?

Peppermint Butler Apparition:  Momo, you were this close to recreating me. Your destiny.

Pep:  You're not my destiny. You're my...

Peppermint Butler Apparition:  Stop!

Pep:  ...past.

Cadebra:  Oh, no.

Pep:  Listen. I still wanna be a powerful wizard jerk. Just not him.

Weapon Head the Third:  So crazy first week, right? Peppermint, for your semi-heroic deeds in defeating the dark wizards, who for some reason had tenure and not me, your right to roam the city has been restored.

[Cheers and applause]

Weapon Head the Third:  And today, I, Weapon Head the Third, as new headmaster, hereby promote you to the rank of salamander. More of this. More cheering.

Pep:  Professor Weapon Head...

Cadebra:  Why'd you turn down salamander? It's what you wanted.

Pep:  Eh, shortcuts kinda give me the creeps now. And the long road doesn't sound so bad... when you have a good travel buddy.

Cadebra:  Awww, pal.

Pep:  Oof.

Cadebra:  So, ready to try that spell?

Pep:  Mm-hmm. Um, I think this is yours, actually.

Cadebra:  Yeah...I know.

Pep and Cadebra:  Corpus petramo cancelo turn Larry back.

Larry:  [is no longer a rock] Huh? Oh, boy! I can't wait to see Spader now that I have eyes again. Where is he?

Choose Goose:  [groaning] Being Choose Goose is no lark... especially now that I'm turning dark. [laughs]

[Thunder crashes]
