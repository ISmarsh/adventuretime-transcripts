[The episode begins in the Fire Kingdom during a battle. Fire people chant in the distance.]
Flame Crowd:  Smash the nerds! Smash the nerds! Nerds, nerds, smash the nerds! A nerdless world is the best kind of world! Nerd, nerds, no more nerds!
[Grunting]
Fire Finn:  Heh...hah... Heh...hah... Heh...hah...hah...
Jake:  Finn! Fight, fight, fight.
Jake:  Finn, stop. What happened to getting the fire jewel and saving Ooo? Is this about your ex?
Fire Finn:  This is about the purity of battle.
Jake:  Okay, but you usually have a reason for fighting.
Fire Finn:  The fiery heartbeat of battle is its own reason.
Jake:  No, that's stupid.
Fire Finn:  Yah!
Jake:  Oh, Glob!
Fire Finn:  Just listen to the beat of your hero heart.
Jake:  I only hear the drums of war.
Fire Finn:  [grunts]
Jake:  What drums?
Fire Finn:  No!
Jake:  [grunts] Finn! You're hurting me physically and emotionally.
Fire Finn:  [grunts] Oh.
Jake:  Fight, fight...
LSP:  Dang it, Finn. Becoming a crazy, fiery bad boy has made you even more of a babe.

[Scene changes to Ice King and LSP on a magic carpet.]
Ice King:  Check it out, LSP.
LSP:  Wha?
Ice King:  It's a real magic flying carpet. I feel just like Scheherazade.
Betty:  Lump creature, did you get the fire jewel?
LSP:  No. Flame Princess freakin' ate it. And now the fire guys are attacking the Candy Kingdom because they took everything I said the wrong way. And that's totally on them. But also, we lost Finn to the flames of war!
Betty:  Okay. I'll go find him.
Ice King:  Finn? Finn? Oh, where are you, pal?
Ice King:  [gasps] It's Gunther. He's in flames, too.
LSP:  We have to rub soothing lotion on Guntzy. You got any lotion?
Ice King:  Your skin is so hydrated.

[Scene changes to the Candy Kingdom. Fun and Nectr play a card game.]
Fun:  Hmm. Got any... Caramel Crunch Pies?
[Groans]
Nectr:  [laughs] Yes!
Fun:  Oh, man, I don't think you should play this game ever again. You're too good at it.
Nectr:  What is that sound?
[Drums beating in distance]
Fun:  Ooh, company's coming!
Fun and Nectr:  [both cheering] Whoo!
Nectr:  Whoo!
Fun:  Yes!
Fun:  Mm! Look at all these thirsty customers!
[Ding!]
Nectr:  Ooh, the pies are ready!
Fun:  Mm! Ice-cream pies for all our hot new friends!
Nectr:  Aah!
[Sizzling]
Fun and Nectr:  [both laughing] Whoa!
Fun:  Mm!
[Sizzle!]
Nectr:  Maybe they don't like lemonade.
Fun:  [laughs]

[Scene changes to Ice King finding Gunther in the battle.]
Ice King:  Gunther, your ride is here.
[Foosh!]
Ice King:  Gee, who sneezed in your corn flakes?
Betty:  He's gone. The fire has taken his mind.
Ice King:  Is this true, Goontz?
Gunter:  Wenk! Wenk! Wenk!
[Flame Crowd grunting]
Ice King:  Look, weird lady, I don't know you and you don't know me, but we're the only sane people left in this crazy, mixed-up world. Or maybe the world's fine and we're the ones losing our marbles. Either way, it's up to us to save the day.
Betty:  Simon.
Ice King:  So, let's get in there and mash their potatoes. You got any mashed potatoes? I'm hungry.
Ice King and Betty:  [both scream]
Flame Crowd:  Nerds.

[Betty searches for Finn in the chaos.]
Betty:  [panting] I have to hurry. All this chaos and mayhem is just -- ugh!
Betty:  Finn! You have to stop this. Think of Jake. How are you going to fix him if you're a fire bozo? And if not for Jake, do it for me.
Fire Finn:  Aah!
Betty:  Oh, my side.
Flame Crowd:  [chanting] Nerds, nerds, smash the nerds! A nerdless world is the best kind of world! Nerd, nerds, no more nerds!

[Scene changes to Princess Bubblegum confronting Flame Princess at the tower.]
[Bubblegum humming]
Princess Bubblegum:  My children have come home.
Flame Princess:  We've come for you!
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, a dragon, how fun! I can do a dragon. Look. [roars] I see you've been playing with matches.
Flame Princess:  Fight me, nerd!
Princess Bubblegum:  [giggles] Whoo-hoo-hoo! [giggles] Are we wrasslin'? Fun!
[Giggling]
[Grunting]
Flame Princess:  Aah! Stop having fun!
Princess Bubblegum:  Huh?
Betty:  [gasps] Finn, no!
Fire Finn:  Yah!
Betty:  This isn't you!
Fire Finn:  [grunts]
Betty:  You're being a very naughty boy, Finn!

[LSP watches the battle unfold from above.]
LSP:  Oh, Glob. Everyone I know is spazzing out on each other. They're spazzing each other to death!
[Foosh!]
[Foosh!]
LSP:  Is this the end? Will I be the last witness to the glory of this world that I chose above all others?
Marshmaline:  [giggling] Tickle, tickle, tickle. [giggles]
LSP:  [gasps] Marceline!
LSP:  I got you!
[Splat!]
LSP:  [groans] I got burned.
LSP:  [laughs weakly] Oh, Marcy. I don't think I can save the world on my own. I'm more of an aspiring hero than a real one. I got, like, the morals and the charisma and the good looks, but I lack field experience! Why couldn't I just get morphed like everyone else? Curse these superior genes!
Marshmaline:  [laughs] Have some marshmallow, dude. It'll calm you down.
LSP:  Mm. [slurps] Mmm. [munches]
[Inhales, exhales deeply]
LSP:  [softly] Your face tastes like my happy place.

[Fire Finn attacks with his sword.]
Fire Finn:  Rah!
[Sword swings]
LSP:  [gasps] Ahh!
Fire Finn:  Fire Finn rules!
[Grunting]
Fire Finn:  Hah...hah...hah. It's time to go professional. Hah...hah...yah.

[Fire Finn approaches the tower where Princess Bubblegum waits.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn! My little sugarplum. You've returned to accept your sweet fate.
Fire Finn:  I ain't sweet! I'm a pure warrior with guns, and I'ma murder you for funs! Rahhh!
LSP:  No! You can't stab a person you love, Finn!
Fire Finn:  I'll stab you!
LSP:  Aah!
Fire Finn:  Oof.
LSP:  Hmm. I'm sending you to your... happy place!
[Sizzle!]
Fire Finn:  [sniffs, snorts]
LSP:  Here, take it, you cutie.
Fire Finn:  Rawr!
LSP:  [echoing] I said your happy place. Happy place!

[Finn calms down as LSP feeds him marshmallow.]
Finn:  I wish I could stay like this.
[Foosh!]
[Sizzle!]
LSP:  I've enjoyed just -- just hanging out.
Finn:  Me too.
[Soft sizzling]
LSP:  You did it, LSP. I'm human Finn.
Finn:  There's no time for romance, Finn. We got to get that jewel.
LSP:  Oh, yeah.
Finn:  Hup! I'm bringing you back, Bonnie.
Princess Bubblegum:  [giggles] That's sweet.
Finn:  Hup.
Princess Bubblegum:  Aah! Sweet, but not sweet enough.
Finn and LSP:  [both screaming]
Princess Bubblegum:  [giggling] Eeh! Ugh!
