[It all starts showing the city of Fionna's world, it is a snowy morning with blue sky. Gary is then shown outside Fionna's apartment knocking on the door.]

[Screams]
[Knock on door]
Gary Prince:  Fionna?

Gary Prince:  Fionna, why aren't you texting me back?

Gary Prince:  You're supposed to help me shop today.

[Door creaks]

Fionna:  Oh, my God!

[Dramatic music plays]

Gary Prince:  She's been robbed!

Ice Scout:  Nah. Aah!

Fionna:  This is just the way she lives.

Ice Scout:  Who are you?!

Winter King:  Who are you?

[Wind howling]

[Scarab growls]

[Panting] Whoa!

Fionna:  Simon!

[All gasp] Come here!

[Laughs] Worry not, friends.

Winter King:  You're safe now.

Fionna:  Ah!

Winter King:  The rascal is frozen inside my inescapable magic ice.

Winter King:  Ha ha!

Simon:  You?

Winter King:  You. Blue blazes!

Simon:  You're a Simon.

Winter King:  In this world, I'm known as the Winter King.

[Shimmering]

[Creak!]

Fionna:  Yoink. Whoa! Whoa!

Cake:  Aah! Cake: Okay, let's go!

[Cake screeches]

[Grumbles]

Fionna:  Cake didn't mean any harm.

Winter King:  A cat named cake? Ha ha! Outrageous!

Winter King:  And what is your name, fair lady?

Fionna:  I'm Fionna.

Winter King:  Fionna.

Fionna:  Uh, the reason we need this crown is to transform Simon.

Fionna:  Our world depends on him becoming cursed and magical again.

Winter King:  Is this true, fellow Petrikov?

Simon:  Yeah. I need to get my powers back.

Winter King:  I understand your plight.

Winter King:  While you can't take my crown, I believe I can find a solution.

Winter King:  This is going to sound nuts, but I think I've been dreaming about you.

Fionna:  Ha ha! I wouldn't be at all surprised.

Winter King:  I'm radical.

[Giggles]

Simon:  This is your throne room?

Winter King:  Do you like it?

Winter King:  It's encased entirely in a beautiful dome of clear ice.

[Shuddering] Yeah, I can tell.

[Shudders] Ice Scouts!

Winter King:  Some hot chocolate?

Ice Scouts:  Yes, your grace. Yes, your grace.

Fionna:  Ooh! Ooh!

Simon:  Lemme ask you something.

Winter King:  Is it about the chocolate?

Simon:  How are you so... functional if you're just another cursed Simon?

Simon:  How have you done all this?

Winter King:  Oh, dear sweet Simon.

Winter King:  Allow me to share that wisdom.

Winter King:  If I may.

Winter King:  It's so hard to resist the crown's power and do something really wonderful.

Winter King:  Hard? [Laughs]

Winter King:  Come, now. Making something wonderful is as easy as manifesting your own reality.

Winter King:  Once I've made you a duplicate magic crown,

Winter King:  Fionna-world will be restored to its former state.

Fionna:  Uh... Wait.

Simon:  If you tinker with the original curse,

Fionna:  will I still be able to fight in the new version?

Fionna:  I got stomped in the last world.

Simon:  Hmm.

[Triumphant music plays]

Fionna:  Wait. I can have this?

Ice Scout:  Ice Scouts, attack!

[Clanging]

Winter King:  Ha ha! Ice Scouts, un-attack!

Ice Scout:  Ahhhh!

Winter King:  Cake the cat, since I'm giving out gifts, is there anything you desire?

Cake:  You can charge this phone.

[Laughs]

[Whoosh, beep]

Fionna:  Whoa! It's at 100%!

Ice Scout:  We even have bars now.

Winter King:  Yes! Ha ha! I make everything better!

Simon:  Man, I suck.

[Cellphone chimes] It's Gary.

Gary Prince:  "Hey, where did you go? Seriously, where are you?

Gary Prince:  Are you dead? Ha ha.

Gary Prince:  Fionna, you're supposed to help me shop today.

Cake:  Aah! A random man took a shower in your apartment.

Gary Prince:  Are you okay?"

Cake:  I'm starting to freak now.

Cake:  Okay, just chill out.

Cake:  Fionna does random, flighty stuff all the time.

Cake:  She's probably okay.
[Cellphone chimes]

Fionna:  "I'm ok!"

[Sighs]

Fionna:  Okay, but that doesn't let you off the hook.

[Cellphone chimes]

Fionna:  "And the random dude is probably Marshall Lee."

Cake:  See? I was right.

Simon:  I'm so glad she's okay.

Fionna:  But I can't believe she's flaking out on me again!

[Grunts]

Cake:  Where you goin'?

Fionna:  I need to run a ton of errands and work on my baking.

Cake:  Did you make those little biscuit guys

Cake:  Fionna was carrying around?

Gary Prince:  Yo, those were hella good. Thanks.

Cake:  Is there food where you're heading?

Fionna:  Uh, yeah, probably. Cool.

Cake:  I'm starving. Um...

Simon:  Have you heard of this place called Joy?

Cake:  Bring me back something.

Simon:  Uh, are you sure it's not too much trouble?

Winter King:  You just relax, Simon.

Winter King:  It will take just one week to make a duplicate crown in my laboratory.

Cake:  A week?! Psst! Don't be rude.

Winter King:  In the meantime, please feel free to partake in the pleasures of the Winter Kingdom.

Fionna:  Fionna, let's check that place out.

Cake:  It looks gnarly as hell.

Winter King:  No, no.

Winter King:  That place is forbidden.

Winter King:  I mean, it can be dangerous out there.

Simon:  Would you help me in the laboratory?

Ice Scouts:  Fionna! Fionna!

Ice Scouts:  Come and join us in our training session!

Fionna:  I'll be right down. Stay here so you don't get lost.

Cake:  Lost? Pssh!

Cake:  We wouldn't be going on any of these adventures if I hadn't gotten "lost."

[Bass playing]

Cake:  Cat. Aah!

Winter King:  Get out of my head!

Fionna:  Wait. Can you hurt me from in there?

Winter King:  You two are abominations, a disease.

Winter King:  I'll break free of this prison, and once free, I will rain down upon...

Marshall Lee:  This doesn't seem like your part of town.

Marshall Lee:  Are you kidding? This is where the good stuff is!

[Beeping]

Fionna:  Dang.

Marshall Lee:  Hey. I'm here to pick up my order.

Simon:  This place has the absolute best cocoa powder.

Simon:  It's so rich, you can't try even a grain of it unadulterated without going mad!

Simon:  Try it.

Marshall Lee:  Whew! This must be why your biscuits boys are so special.

Simon:  I call them, uh, pastrymenschen.

Simon:  I've been working on the prototypes for a long time.

Simon:  I have a 64-step business plan, and getting the recipe right is key.

Marshall Lee:  Hey, all I want is more of these pastry people.

Marshall Lee:  What's it gonna take to make that happen?

Simon:  Well, I need my own bakery, where I can make what I want, so that means cash, mostly.

Simon:  There's a couple of investors in town I really want to meet.

Simon:  They're called the Lemoncarbs.

Simon:  They're these rich twins behind a food empire.

Simon:  One meeting with them could change my life.

Fionna:  Oh, yeah, I think I heard my mom talking about them before or something.

Simon:  I-I'm sorry. I'm probably boring you.

Fionna:  No, no. I-I think it's cool.

Fionna:  I mean, you're just so passionate.

Simon:  It's just... impressive... to me.

Simon:  Thank you.

Cake:  Thank you again for the suit. Nonsense. You looked ugly.

Cake:  Oh, my!

[Whistles]

Cake:  Careful.

Winter King:  Commence duplication. [Zaps]

Simon:  I have so many questions.

Simon:  Is there a Betty in this world?

Winter King:  Betty? Betty...

[Clicks tongue]

[Laughs] The dead one!

Simon:  Yeah, I haven't thought about her in a long time.

Winter King:  But how could you say that?

Simon:  She was the great love of our life.

Winter King:  Hmm. Well, that's not how I remember it.

Winter King:  Well, once you get this new crown, you can always use it to make an Ice Betty.

Winter King:  Ha ha! I'm just kidding.

Simon:  Uh, that would be unethical.

[Alarm blaring]

Ice Scout:  Invasion! Invasion!

Marshall Lee:  Is someone cooking maple syrup in here?

Marshall Lee:  'Cause I smell somethin' saucy!

[Laughs maniacally]

Winter King:  Princess Bubblegum?

Simon:  No. It's the Candy Queen.

Simon:  Sworn enemy of the Winter Kingdom and a terrible nuisance to me, personally.

Marshall Lee:  Baby, baby, why you gotta be like that?

Winter King:  Begone, vile candy witch! [Straining]

Fionna:  What?

Winter King:  Oh, right. The crown.

[Straining] Gives up.

Fionna:  Bubblegum, stop!

Gary Prince:  What? I'm seeing double.

Candy Queen:  And I love it!

[Candy Queen laughing]

Winter King:  Assistance!

Ice Scout:  She's got Simon!

Fionna:  It's cool. This happens all the time.

Winter King:  If you come along, Fionna, and aid us with your magical sword...

Winter King:  We can rescue them both!

Fionna:  Action stuff.

[Laughs] Whoo-hoo!

[Slurps] So, where to next?

[Keys jingle, lock engages]

Fionna:  Let's go!

Cake:  Wait. You're stealing kitchen time?

Fionna:  That's kind of punk.

Cake:  Ha! Maybe I am kinda punk.

Fionna:  You coming?

Cake:  I'll be there in a sec.

[Beeping]

Fionna:  Hey, it's me.

[Panting]

[Laughs maniacally]

[All grumbling]

[Crash]

Fionna and Cake:  ♪ We're back ho-ome! ♪

[Both groan]

[Straining]

Winter King:  Ta-da!

Fionna:  Aah! [Screams]

[Grunts] Let us out!

Marshall Lee:  No requests. I only do originals.

Gary Prince:  No need to worry.

Fionna:  This maniac has kidnapped me lots of times.

Winter King:  She thinks we belong together.

Fionna:  But why?

Winter King:  ♪ You can't make ice cream without mixing cream and ice ♪

Winter King:  ♪ You can't make gingersnaps without mixing sugar and spice ♪

Winter King:  ♪ You can't make cinnamon rolls without kneading the dough ♪

Winter King:  ♪ And I can't let you go ♪

Winter King:  ♪ 'Cause I need you so ♪

Winter King:  ♪ And so I'm gonna put you into a blender with me ♪

Winter King:  ♪ Set the oven to 350 degrees ♪

Winter King:  ♪ And together forever we will always be ♪

Winter King:  ♪ Baked with love ♪

Winter King:  ♪ Just like cake needs to rise ♪

Winter King:  ♪ If you look in my eyes ♪

Winter King:  ♪ You'll see the recipe is true ♪

Winter King:  ♪ The key ingredient is you ♪

Simon:  And you.

Fionna:  That's actually a nice metaphor.

Winter King:  Not a metaphor.

Cake:  So, this happens a lot?

Winter King:  Not this part. This is an escalation.

[Groans]

Gary Prince:  And... yes!

Gary Prince:  Here.

Gary Prince:  Holy crap! This is sublime.

Fionna:  Yeah?

Gary Prince:  I think you're ready to show your goods to some investors, like those Lemoncarbs.

Fionna:  What?! Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Fionna:  These still need work.

Fionna:  I would just die of embarrassment if I had to show this version to the Lemoncarbs.

Cake:  Yeah. Um, I'll be... I'll be right back.

Ice Scout:  Hurry up! Get back!

[Indistinct shouting]

Everything okay?

Gary Prince:  Uh... surprise!

Fionna:  "Buttery... Buns?"

Ice Scout:  This is the address she gave us.

Winter King:  Open the door!

[Gasps]

[All grumbling]

Ice Scouts:  For the king!

[All shouting]

Fionna:  Nice!

Ice Scout:  Fionna! Incoming!

Fionna:  This is the feeling I've been chasing!

Fionna:  Hyah! This is what was missing!

[Laughs] Hyah!

Fionna:  Onward!

[Humming]

Winter King:  Ice scouts!

Cake:  This would be a good time to show up at the last second!

Simon:  She deserves our help.

Simon:  I know there's a brilliant person in there... trying to get out.

Fionna:  Oh, we don't need to fix her. We just need to be rescued.

Winter King:  Ice scouts! Help!

[Click, whirring]

[Crack]

Hi, Lemoncarbs.

My name is Gary Prince, and I'd like you to meet...

the pastrymenschen.

Hmm! Hmm!

Mm! Mm!

[Chomping]

Eh. It tastes nice, but...

I hate their little faces! Meh!

No, see, that's part of it.

All of the baked goods are characters,

and the bakery is like their kingdom.

[Groans]

For instance, if you buy the "choco-berry,"

you get a discount on Mr. Cupcake

because they're married.

It's food with a story.

Here, we have Cinnamon Bun.

He's got the biggest heart of all.

Hyah!

But you better watch your pocket change

when the scampish Marshmallow Kids are around.

I've created an array of friends

that will change and grow over time.

You won't believe your eyes.

So, what do you think?

[Chairs screech]

We hate it!

[Tires squeal]

[Groans] Ohhhh!

Hyah! Hyah!

Winter King:  Help! Simon: Help!

Simon:  Fionna! Cake!

She's going to make us into batter!

Hi! Bunny girl!

[Growls] [Squeals]

Aaaah! [Splat]

Hyah!

Candy Queen!

Unh-unh. Not your business.

[Groans] Fionna, stop!

There's something wrong with her brain,

but it can be fixed!

[Grunts] No, it can't! Knock her out!

Yes, my King! Hyah!

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

Hyah!

[Both straining]

[Whirring stops]

[All groaning]

Thank you, brave hero!

Oh.

Your crown.

Winter King:  Fionna...

indeed, you are both beauty and the beast.

Ice Prince, am I dreaming?

Embrace me, fair Fionna!

Okay!

Huh? What's... happening?

M-My magic... i-it's gone!

Fionna, help me!

[Crunches]

Just metal and glass.

[Candy Queen groans]

Huh?

Winter King:  Princess Bubblegum!

I'm free!

The curse has been lifted!

Now it all makes sense.

Winter King cast a spell

to project the madness of the crown on to you.

Yeah. He zapped it right into my brain-basket.

What a wad.

Yes.

And he kept doing that.

Yeah. For a hundred years!

Yeah. I'm trying not to dwell on it.

I apologize for the terrible behavior of my fellow Simon.

But I do feel kinda vindicated.

There is much work to be done.

Where are my beloved candy citizens?

[All groaning] Uh... we'll... we'll go look.

It's like a fairy tale.

Your kiss removed the curse.

I thank you, brave knight.

I'm not a brave knight.

What did I do wrong?

What you did wrong is exist.

Simon, get us out of here!

[Screeches, growls]

At least they seemed to like the flavors.

Look, I'm... I'm sorry I sprang that on you.

I thought I... I thought I was helping.

But I-I shoulda asked.

It's probably good they came now.

I would have fiddled with that pastry recipe forever

So, where does a chocolate-dipped strawberry

go to meet a cupcake, anyway?

Ah, come on. Don't make fun of me.

I really wanna know.

Well... it's... it's kind of a funny story.

[Chuckles] It all began in the middle of a

slumber party/candy-zombie outbreak...

[Squeaks]

This one's not gonna work either.

[Cries]

What's wrong, Fi?

[Sighs] Back there, I thought I was living my dream.

But I was just hurting a bunch of innocent candy people.

Have I been hurting people in all these universes?

That place was messed up

because that Simon was messed up.

The next world will have a magic crown that will work,

and I'll be cursed the right way.
