Minerva:  Susan? I mean, Kara?

Man:  Seems like you're leading us somewhere.

Minerva:  We're taking a ship to Founders Island, because judging by the state of these facilities...

Minerva:  ...Hub Island has been abandoned for over a decade.

Man:  Dang, I missed big words.

Minerva:  This island is where I trained to be a Seeker.

Man:  So, wait, why are we going to Founders Island?

Minerva:  I'm taking you back to your mom.

Man:  BMO, would you talk to this console?

Minerva:  I can‘t access it without my implant.

Man:  Um...you knew my mom?

Man:  You're gonna just drop that?!

Minerva:  Her name is Minerva.

Minerva:  She's a Helper.
[Ding]

Dr. Gross:  Oh, thanks, BMO.

Now let's try and start this sucker.

[Horn honks]

Together:  What's happening? Are we being arrested?

Minerva:  Don't worry, ladies. I'll get you to your senior swim class.

Together:  Thank you, Dr. Minnie.

Oh!
Whoa!

[Gasps]

[Tires screech]

[Muffled voice] Hey, it‘s not a crosswalk, ya know!

It's —— It's not a...
[Groans]

Man:  The end.

Seeker:  You have been listening to ”Wizards Way. "

Man:  So I hear you guys wanna do some explorin"?

Minerva:  Canteens. Cool.

Dr. Gross:  So what do you got for me?

Man:  Credits? I don't take credits.

Dr. Gross:  I want gadgets.

Man:  See this gum? It used to be a book on tape.

Dr. Gross:  Gadgets.

Minerva:  Hmm.

[Whirring]

[Gasps coughs]

Man:  Hey, not bad.

Man:  I'll take it.

Man:  Get down to Basket Beach, and I'll meet you at the boat in 30 minutes.

Minerva:  -[Beep] — Hey, there.

Minerva:  Uh, you got a couple of Hiders headed for Basket Beach.

Minerva:  You're welcome. Bye.

Man:  Yah!

Minerva:  You startled me.
[Laughs]

Man:  We understand that you can get us past the Seekers.

Minerva:  Yeah, but you just missed today's boat.

Dr. Gross:  We understand that you like gadgets?

Seeker:  I do like them.

[Click]

Dr. Gross:  Hello. Hello. Hello.

Minerva:  I don't like it. I love it!

Man:  Tell ya what, get yourself down to Basket Beach ASAP.

Minerva:  You're not coming with us?

Dr. Gross:  Once I determine you haven't been followed,

Dr. Gross:  I will join you at the boat.

Man:  We insist you join us now.

Seeker:  Let's go to the beach.

Dr. Gross:  Bring back those Hiders, y’all!

[Alarm blaring]

Man:  Aah!

Dr. Gross:  What do you got for me, Kara?

Kara:  A sad ol' Hider with two busted legs.

Dr. Gross:  Oh, I love busted legs!

[Groans]

Dr. Gross:  When will he be at full health?

Dr. Gross:  Tomorrow morning.

Dr. Gross:  Okay, I'll have a transport here in the morning to shuttle him to re—ed.

Man:  Re—education.

Dr. Gross:  Oh, you're awake.

Dr. Gross:  We set both your legs. They were broken.

Dr. Gross:  Other than that, you only have psychological problems.

Man:  Well, I could've told you that.

Minerva:  You don't look like a Hider.
I'm not.

Man:  It was a wrong place, wrong time type of deal.

Minerva:  It's true! I love it here!

So. . .white hat.

Dr. Gross:  You're a Helper, huh?
Yes.

Man:  I think that fella's still alive.

Dr. Gross:  Hello. Hello. Hello.

Minerva:  Very funny.

If I don't see you before tomorrow, enjoy re—education.

You're leavin'?
Minerva:  I have things to do.

Man:  What am I gonna look at when you leave?

Dr. Gross:  Leave some flowers or somethin'!

Minerva:  These are in the trash?

I think someone died.
Oh, that's great!

Dr. Gross:  You're trying to escape?

Minerva:  No! I'm ——

Wrong place, wrong time?

Minerva:  No, no. I have to, uh...

[crunch]
Man:  Aah!

Man:  Aah!

[Clank]
Seeker:  Uhh!

Man:  Aah!

Minerva:  This is kind of a setback.

Minerva:  But nothing a good night's sleep can't fix.

Dr. Gross:  You're not sleeping tonight. You've got a serious concussion.

And I'm not sleeping tonight...
[Click]

...because apparently you need a babysitter.

Minerva:  I'm not a baby.
Okay.

Man:  Aah!

Minerva:  Keep those elevated.

Minerva:  I have to figure out a new lineup for the JV curling team.

You wanna sign my cast?

Man:  Which one?

[Chuckles] You're all right, Doc.

Finn:  Hey, you know I'm not going to re—ed tomorrow, right?

Dr. Gross:  Oh, yeah?

I'll tell 'em this was just a misunderstanding,

Man:  and then I'll glide out the front door a free man.

Dr. Gross:  Free to have dinner...with you?

Man:  If you wanted to.

Dr. Gross:  I mean, I—I want to.

Finn:  So what are you, a con artist or something?

Man:  Yeah, you make it sound so glamorous.

How about me? How would you con me?

Man:  I wouldn't con you. I wanna have dinner with you.

[Laughs]

Okay, but if you had to, how would you do it?

Minerva:  Um, okay, you like helping people, right?

Man:  So I'd get you to feel sorry for me.

Man:  I'd act real pitiful.

Minerva:  I don't think that would work.

Man:  I mean, you're number one at number two, after all.

[Laughing]
[Laughs]

Martin:  You saw my underwear! You're —— [Laughs]

Minerva:  Oh!
Martin:  You're all right, Doc.

[Pounding on door]

Seeker:  Open up!

Minerva:  Sure thing. Just a ——

Give me a boost, Doc!

[Door clanks]

Minerva:  Oh, uh, hello, Dr. Campbell.

Dr. Gross:  Prepare for re—education, Mertens!

Minerva:  You got the wrong man, fella.

I've been helping beefcakes like you catch Hiders for months.

Dr. Gross:  We know you've been playing both sides.

You think that's not hurtful?

Minerva:  Uh—oh. That was kind of my only plan.

[Sobbing]

Minerva:  You finally ran out of quarters, didn't you, Marty?

[Sobbing]

Minerva:  Poor little Marty!

[Sobbing continues]

Minerva:  Hold up, guys!

Minerva:  Hey, I'm so sorry about this,

but I was completing checkout forms for Mr. Mertens,

Dr. Gross:  and it turns out he's medically unfit for re—ed.

He's got a rare condition called garbage body.

Man:  Uh, that sounds completely fake

Minerva:  coming from anybody but you, Dr. Campbell!

[Laughs]

Dr. Gross:  See you at the Fun Run!

That was breathtaking con work, Doc.

Man:  Hey, can you run a load of laundry?

Dr. Gross:  You got it.

Should I order us something for ——

Veggie thali and a mango Iassi!

[Tires screech]

[Crickets chirp]

[Laughs] Yeah, that's Mr. Bear.

Man:  Pretty interesting guy, huh?

Minerva:  Where the heck is Mommy's Indian food, huh?

[Laughs] Hey, look what you got.

Minerva:  That's one of my old gadgets, the breadstick wand.

[Crying]
[Running footsteps]

Minerva:  That must be the grub.

[Thud]
Aaayyy!

[Whirring]

Finn:  Hey.

Jake:  Oh. Hey, what's up?

Finn:  Nothing. I just haven't said anything in a while.

This party is so crazy!
