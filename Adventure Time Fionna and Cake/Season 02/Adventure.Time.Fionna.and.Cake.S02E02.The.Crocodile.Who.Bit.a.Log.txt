Spirit Dream Warrior:  Hey-oh. Again.
[whack]
[straining]
[gnawing]
[applauds]
Spirit Dream Warrior:  Huntress, you ran those first rites like a pro. If you still seek power, the tooth must bite.
[grunts]
Spirit Dream Warrior:  Dang. You didn't even blink. On to the heart. When you came to me years ago, I promised to lead you down the path, the path you needed.
Huntress:  Mm. Oh, wait a minute. We're this way. Whoa. Get back, ya nasty. Green Wizards only. Oh, Spirit Dream Warrior. Hmm... Another one? Our order doesn't need any more strays. Relax, Witch Wizard. I wouldn't bring you a scrub. She's paid her dues. Go on. Fine.
[crackles]
Huntress:  [wizards chanting] One with the heart. Keep its mysteries on lock. Green Wizards only. Well, looks like you're one of us now. No, I'm on my own.
[opening theme music playing]
[metallic clunks]
[groans]
Huntress:  Get ready. Uh, Fi, should we be doing it this way? Maybe we can look up squatters' rights or something. Come on, Cake.
[grunts]
[straining]
[rattling]
Huntress:  Be sure to get my mixer and spatulas. Oh, and don't forget my sprinkles. I meant the silver jimmies. This mixer is like his child. Cool.
[gasps]
[objects clattering]
[light switch clicks]
Huntress:  I think Queenie's up. We can take her.
[grunts]
Man:  Put that crockery back. Come get rolled.
[- You! - Hey... hey, hey, hey.]
Man:  Let's just be civil. I'm not taking orders from no cat.
[growls]
[screams]
Man:  Shoot! My glasses. Hey. Kheirosiphon? Why are you helping Queenie?
[blows]
Man:  Yeah, we technically freed you. Sorry. I got laid off from the tea shop. I need the money. Yeah, I get it, man. Jobs are a farce. Now, scram!
[yells]
[screams]
Man:  Not cool! Come on! Come on!
[grunts]
Man:  Go! Go! And stay out! [groans] What's my life... Witch Wizard. Still on guard duty. Huntress Wizard. What's up? That a new top? No. Yeah. No, it is. It is, actually. Why have you come to this hallowed place? Uh... I was just in the local area, communing with branches. How have you been doing?
[hisses]
Man:  Whoa, bro. What the fig! Look, I'm only gonna take a little. [gasps] Heresy. He needs it, my friend.
[laughing]
Man:  The blood loaf that choked me out. You've told him our secret! Traitor. [screams] Traitor! I told Finn about this place specifically so he would stay away. He deserves to die.
[heart thumping]
[panting]
[explosion]
[growling]
Man:  Got you!
[laughs]
Man:  Quit it!
[grunts]
[- [swish] - [grunts]]
[growls]
Man:  Huh?
[- [straining] - [teeth shattering]]
[cries]
Man:  My teeth.
[grunts]
[straining]
Man:  I know what I'm doing, Witch. No, no! Stay away from the heart. It's forbidden. Something catastrophic could happen. Like what? Uh, something dirty.
[inhales]
Man:  For Finn. [gasps] No!
[sighs in relief]
[- [pouring] - [gasps]]
[straining]
Man:  Oh, no.
[earth trembling]
[birds cawing]
Man:  I told you!
[panting]
[bellows]
Man:  I didn't know.
[bellowing continues]
[panting]
Man:  What's happening?
[grunts]
Man:  Why didn't you listen?
Blade Wizard:  The hell? Witch Wizard, what goes on here?
[shudders]
Blade Wizard:  [gasps] The source! She did this. I... I didn't mean to. Seize her. Huh? You've doomed us all.
[- [screams] - Kill her!]
Blade Wizard:  [pops lips] We'll have to go analog.
[- [wick hisses] - [grunts]]
[explosion]
[grunting]
[explosions]
Blade Wizard:  Whoa! [grunts] What?
Huntress:  Witch Wizard! No. Finn!
[- [straining] - [wick hissing]]
Huntress:  Huh?
[explosion]
Huntress:  Well, it finally happened.I lost the bar.[cries]
[audience laughing]
[glass breaking]
Huntress:  So no tab then? [Norm cries] Frasier, the took Cheers.Frasier:  Heavens!That's terrible. [groans] Piece of junk.
Frasier:  Let mebuy you a drink, Sam.Sam:  It's my bar.[audience laughing]
Cliff:  Was your bar. Since when did greyhounds have onions in them? She's still sore about when I worked here.
[- [munching] - [Ruby] Sore?]
Cliff:  You broke all my top shelf liquor doing your stupid routines. It's called flair. Check it.
[gulping]
[glass breaking]
Cliff:  I'll pay for that.
[grumbling]
Cliff:  Sorry, Cakey. Haven't I been embarrassed enough?
[- Does it hurt? - [scoffs] Nah.]
Cliff:  And now that I know we're dealing with firepower, I can put him out.
[straining]
Cliff:  Ruby, you got any oven mitts or foil I can wrap myself in? Cake, he's a fire god. I don't want you to get hurt again. [sighs] Okay. I still think I can take him, though. Don't pet-ronize me. I'm a grown woman.
[chuckles]
[Gary sighs]
Gary:  I'm really sorry I suggested the spot. I thought it was abandoned. I mean, technically, we did squat there. Yeah, but the whole concept of ownership is jacked.
[phone vibrating]
Gary:  [groans] Where am I gonna live now? You could always, you know, stay at my place. Oh. Um... Really? Aw, you angels. But what about your bakery dreams? [sighs] Queenie won this one, Fionna.
Cliff:  Aw, don't let himget you down, Sam.Not yet.Cheers can come backbigger and crazier than ever.You can do it.Norm:  You can do it, Sam.Frasier:  Save Cheers.Cliff:  Eh, we gottadrink somewhere. Cliff is right. Cheers... Uh... We just got to come back bigger and crazier than ever.
[- Unstoppable. - [glass shattering]]
[Ruby grumbling]
Kirin:  Oh, how about a leech? Like a giant, magical, healing leech? You know, to suck out all the poison. What? No, no. That doesn't exist. Look for any mentions of "The Heart of the Forest." Check the ancient texts, the new stuff, the joke books. Yes. He seems to be under a powerful enchantment.
Princess Bubblegum:  What does Huntress Wizard say? She didn't. I don't know when Huntress is coming back. Hmm, no mention of a heart, but check it. Distendo!
[pops]
Simon:  Pep. Give him some space, students. Oh, Finn. It's going to be all right. I'm at my wit's end. Don't worry, Simon. I've sent help.
[- [Banana Guard 1 mimics siren] - [engine rumbling]]
[crashes]
[grunts]
Simon:  Another ambulance, please.
[groans]
[ground trembling]
Simon:  Huh?
Fionna:  Kheiro! I'm here to take back what's ours.
[babbles]
Peptank:  You're toast, sucker. [laughs] Yeah. Okay.
[growls]
Peptank:  For a deity, he kind of stuck up. Peptank, take aim. No. No, no, no. Don't blow up my van.
Peptank:  You guys gotta make up your mind. You're wasting a perfectly good tank. Hmm. Hey, look. Look at the sign. You want me to blow up the sign? Yes. Or no, I have a better idea. Let's buy this place. Well, yeah. All of us together? That could be cool.
[- Math... - [wind blowing]]
Peptank:  I'll save you, Sweet Spot. Tank, back it up. I thought you brought me here to level the place. Yeah. That was a bad plan, I guess.
Cake:  Mm-hmm. Well, you still got to hold up your end of the deal. Yeah, yeah.
[hazard beeping]
Finn:  Huntress. I'm thinking about dying soon. Bummer. You're gonna forget all about me. Never. Never. Oh, fig. Huh? Where the crud?
[gasps]
Finn:  Whoa, whoa! Hmm.
[screams]
[grunts]
[munching]
Finn:  Yep, I'm on Babyworld Finn duty tonight. Nah, Peptank's got a thing.
[party music playing]
Finn:  Listen, you're super old. You've probably bought a bunch of property, right? Well, you know, the market was always so crazy and... Stop that. Was I supposed to be saving money this whole time? What the heck is an APR? [groans] How was I supposed to know any of this?
Simon:  Put that away. Are you out? What's all that noise? No. What are you doing? I gotta get the boba out of his neck. That's his Adam's apple. Oh. You're a good doctor.

The Voice:  You all right up there? Huh? Oh, a visitor.[zaps]
The Voice:  Who's there?
[grunts]
The Voice:  This place is crazy.
[screams]
The Voice:  I have to get back to Ooo.
The Voice:  You wish to leavethis place, little homey? Yes.
The Voice:  You justgotta choosewhich directionyou want to grow. Choose.
[growling]
Simon:  I'm in the ambulancewith Finn. There.
Fionna:  Simon! Simon, seriously. What's going on? [Simon sighs] I'm in the ambulance with Finn. Oh, no. Is it bad? Fionna, Finn's gonna be fine. He's got a lot of people pulling for him. But what if people pulling for him doesn't matter? What if they give up on him?
[- We won't. I promise. - [defibrillator charging]]
Banana Guard:  Clear.[- [Banana Guard screams] - [phone call ends]]
[straining]
Banana Guard:  Hey, no!
[sighs]
Banana Guard:  You got to pay attention, baby. That's no way to live.
[blows raspberry]
Banana Guard:  Look, no one taught you anything. And that's not your fault. You're trying your best. But if you don't pull it together, everyone's gonna leave you. Now eat your waffle dog.
Baby Finn:  Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. It's good, I swear. I hope you don't eat it. Then it's all mine. What? You're insulted by reverse psychology? Baby's too smart.
