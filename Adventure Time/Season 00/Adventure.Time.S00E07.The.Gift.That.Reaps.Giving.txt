[The short opens in the Land of the Dead. Death is sitting in his car inside his castle, writing a card for Life's birthday gift.]

Death:  My darling Life. Please accept this... gift. [pauses] Gift. Mmm. [restarts] My darling Life, sweet lily of my desierto. Might I humbly present this?

[Death crumples the card in frustration.]

Death:  I'll just write happy birthday.

[A radio plays in the car.]

Radio DJ:  Spending much of her time living in and eating rocks is what led Caramel Sally, independent rock-eating musician, to create that medley. Now let's hear a track off her latest album, the song's called Lonely Bones.

["Lonely Bones" by Caramel Sally begins playing.]

Death:  Oh! [reaches for his tape deck] Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. I gotta get this on tape for my boo.

[Death presses record on his mixtape player. The tape suddenly jams and starts spewing tape.]

Death:  Oh, no, no! Not during Lonely Bones. Wait, wait. I can fix this.

[Death tries to wind the tape back in.]

Death:  That should do it.

[The tape breaks again.]

Death:  Uh-uh. [sarcastically] Oh, beautiful.

[Death furiously breaks the mixtape in half. Scene transitions to the Candy Kingdom, where a Gumdrop Lass is listening and dancing to Lonely Bones on her own mixtape player. Death lurks behind a bush, pulling out a tiny pen-like scythe.]

Death:  Just one little swoosh of the scythe. [hesitates] Oh, man, this is a new low. If someone saw me, I'd be embarrassed.

Jake:  Hey, Death.

Death:  Hi. Jake.

[Awkward pause.]

Jake:  Whatcha doin'?

Death:  You know, uh, just, uh, bushin'. It's something we do in the land of the dead.

Jake:  Whoa, cool.

[Jake crouches down next to the bush.]

Jake:  Bushin'.

[Scene cuts to Jake with Finn.]

Jake:  Hey, Finn.

Finn:  What's up, man?

Jake:  You gotta try this thing. It's called bushin'.

Finn:  Uh, this seems pretty boring.

Jake:  Well, maybe we're just not doin' it right.

Finn:  Maybe it's one of those things you gotta be already dead to get.

Jake:  I still think it's pretty cool. I don't think we should limit ourselves to new experiences.

[Scene transitions back to the Land of the Dead. Death meets Life outside.]

Death:  Here, happy birthday, Life.

Life:  Oh, another mixtape.

[Beat.]

Life:  That's... cool.

Death:  It's just a CD this time. I know that's not as good.

Life:  Oh, wait, a CD? Yo, I totally have something that can play this in my dad's garage. I can finally actually listen to one of your mixes!

[Life kisses Death.]

Death:  De nada, baby.

[Short ends]
