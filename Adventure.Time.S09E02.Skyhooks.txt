[The episode begins with Finn, Jake, and BMO approaching Ooo on a ship. A ship horn blows.]
Jake:  Heck, yeah! We're home. That was definitely the longest adventure we've ever done.
Finn:  What about when you got trapped in a mind dungeon for a buncha years?
Jake:  This trip was longer in emotional time.
Finn:  Yeah, I'm burnt out. No more adventures for a while, okay?
BMO:  Yes! Yes! Yes! [babbles loudly] B-b-b-b-b-b-b! Let's go take hot showers.
Jake:  Hey, look at this fish.
[Squish]
Jake:  It's... gummy?
Gummy Fish:  [high-pitched voice] Hello! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey!
[Laughing]
Finn:  Well, that's weird. We should defs check it out after we hit up the tree house.
Jake:  Yeah, we gotta get to the bottom of this hot shower.
Finn:  Hmm. Does everything seem... pinker to you?
Jake:  Home always looks different after a long trip. You're seeing it with fresh eyes and newfound wisdom. And sometimes there's also a new strip mall or something. So everything being pink is probably not a big deal. And also, I'm tired.
BMO:  I like the pink.
Jake:  Why you worry so much, worry baby?
BMO:  Ha, ha, yeah! Why you worry so much, worry baby?
Jake:  Don't worry, Finn. We're only teasing you because you're a baby.

[Scene changes to the Treehouse. It's covered in candy.]
Finn:  Whoa! What the heck happened to the tree house? Candy... Fern?
[Squish, dripping]
Jake:  Oh, I do not like this.
BMO:  ♪ Is this some kind of sick joke? Because I love it!
Finn:  Huh? Big Baby root beer? No one buys this brand. It's too sweet. Hello?
Finn and Jake:  [both gasp]
Finn:  Aah! Hey! You look like me!
Jake:  Fern?!
Fun:  Who's Fern? I'm Fun the Human.
Nectr:  And I'm Nectr, the little robot!
Shelby:  I'm Shelby the Worm... the gummy worm! Welcome, strangers. It's so cool that you're inside our house.
Finn:  Dude, when did you guys turn into candy?
Fun:  We've always been candy, you silly billy bean!
Jake:  Ohh, okay. I get it. We've obviously stumbled into another alternate dimension where everyone's a different version of themselves. Yawn.
Finn:  But we haven't gone through any portals.
Jake:  BMO would know.
Nectr:  Hello!
BMO:  Neptr is so cute now! I'm going to start treating him as an equal.
Finn:  You were supposed to take care of Ooo while I was gone. What happened with that?
Fun:  What? You used to be this volatile plant boy. Remember?
Finn:  Really?
Fun:  Well, I'm candy now. And I'm in control of my emotions.
Shelby:  I'm in control, too... of my body! [laughs]
Jake:  Wow, gummy Shelby's a lot of fun. I think I'm okay with Candyworld.
Finn:  No way. Let's talk to PB. I'm sure this is all one of her experiments gone wrong.
Fun:  You seem upset, friend. The tower will fix you right up.
Finn:  The what now?

[Outside, the tower bells ring. Candy citizens gather around.]
[Bell dinging]
Shelby:  Oh, boy! Let's run outside!
[Bell dinging continues]
[Nectr whirring, wheels squeaking]
Lemonpink:  Hello! It's me! Lemonpink!
Jake:  He was inside the lemon.
Lemonpink:  Mm! Drink up, babies!
[Splat]
Lemonpink:  Squeeze! [laughing] I used to have a lot of fear and sadness, but now I'm fine!
Jake:  Hey, I want some of that.
Finn:  No. That is body juice.
Lemonpink:  Hmm? What's that? Do you spurn my fluids?
Finn:  No.
Lemonpink:  Maybe someone's feeling a little sour! Wuh-whoa! You know what sours get.
Candies:  Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower!
[Splat]
Candies:  Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower!
Finn:  Come on, Jake. Let's go see Bubblegum.
[Screaming]
Finn:  Stop striding! It just keeps you agitated!
Jake:  I'm freaking out, Jake. This place is weird.
Finn:  What I'm hearing is you're stressed out because everything's candy.
Jake:  Aren't you?
Finn:  Not really. Lemongrab's always been a weirdo. At least now he's helping people.
[Rumbling]
Jake:  And Fern is, like, laughing and joking around. Maybe they don't need you to fix them.
Finn:  Hmm. I always believe you when you use that voice.

[Finn and Jake hear crying in the distance and find Sweet P.]
[Crying continues]
Finn:  Sweet P?
Sweet P:  [sniffles]
Finn:  Hey, buddy, what are you doing out... uh... Hey! You're meat!
Sweet P:  Yes, I'm meat. [sniffles] But everything else is weird.
Finn:  Wow, Sweet P, that's almost exactly what I've been saying. Sweet P, do you remember what happened?
Sweet P:  One day, the candy came and turned Mommy and Daddy into something... different.
Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig:  Sweet P! There you are! We've been looking for you everywhere! We just love ya so much, son. You're gonna get into a great college!
Mr. Pig:  Tee-hee-hee-hee!
Tree Trunks:  Tee-hee-hee!
Jake:  They look so happy, like dogs.
Finn:  Don't worry, Sweet P. We're headed to the Candy Kingdom to see Princess Bubblegum about all this.
Sweet P:  She's not in the Candy Kingdom. She's in the Terrible Tower. Look!
Jake:  Come on, Jake. That's kind of weird, right?
Finn:  I think it's magnificent!
Tree Trunks:  Sweet P! Yoo-hoo! We brought some rollers and a bucket of sweet juicy caramel. Let's get you back to normal.
Sweet P:  But, Mama, I am normal!
Tree Trunks:  Just sit tight there like a windowpane, and you'll be back to normal like a windowpane. [echoing] Back to normal.
Finn:  Hmm.
Jake:  Okay, you're right. This is pretty freaky-deaky.
Sweet P:  I'm gonna go now.
[Crying]
Jake and Finn:  Sweet P, come back!
[Tree Trunks laughs]
Jake:  Uh... let's get to the tower.

[Scene changes to Finn and Jake walking toward the tower.]
Jake:  ♪ And never be the guy with no phone, Finn. You'll think it'll make people wanna talk to you more, but people just forget to invite you to things.
Finn:  You've convinced me. Plus, I like late night bedtime calls when you're sleeping over at Lady's.
Jake:  [sniffs] Ooh. Somethin' smells nice. Nice and toasty.
[Roars]
Finn, Jake, and BMO:  S'more!
Finn:  Stay back, S'more!
Jake:  Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
[Growls]
Marshmaline:  [laughs] Whoa, dudes. I was just playin'.
Finn, Jake, and BMO:  What?! Marceline!
Marshmaline:  [giggles] No, it's Marshmaline... the Campfire Queen.
BMO:  Mar... Marsha... Marsha... Mars... Marsha... Marcine. Mar... Mar... Marsh... Marshmi... Marshman... My...
Marshmaline:  Would you like to hear a song? I've written just the ditty that'll cheer up anyone that's overwhelmed with work or responsibility.
Jake:  Yay! I love Marshmaline songs!
Finn:  No time for tunes. Do you know where Bonnie is?
Marshmaline:  Of course! Follow me.
[Humming "Greensleeves"]
[Humming continues]
[Humming ends]
Finn:  Marshy... where's PB?
Marshmaline:  She's everywhere.
[Rumbling]

[Marshmaline leads them to the Terrible Tower, where they meet Elemental Bubblegum.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Good tidings to you, my friends.
Jake:  [gasps]
Finn:  [gasps] Yahoo!
Jake:  What... what happened to you?
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, this? [giggles] I've become what I was always meant to become... a pure candy elemental.
[Vomits]
[Laughs, cheering]
Princess Bubblegum:  [belches] 'Scuse me.
Finn:  What about Tree Trunks and Lemongrab and Marceline and everyone else?
Princess Bubblegum:  I fixed 'em, obviously.
Finn:  Fixed 'em? But they're your friends!
Princess Bubblegum:  Those aren't mutually exclusive concepts.
Jake:  That means it's fine.
Finn:  No, it's not fine.
Princess Bubblegum:  Don't fret. I can fix you, too.
[Squishing]
Finn:  Aah! Aah! Aah! I can feel my bones turning gummy!
Jake:  Me, too! We gotta get out of here before... Oof!
Princess Bubblegum:  Hugs! I'm connected to all candy throughout all the galaxies. Once you're candy, you'll be part of me, too!
Finn:  No! That plan sucks!
BMO:  [speaking indistinctly] Oh, my gosh!
Finn:  Aah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Ow!
Ice King:  Skyhooks!
Finn:  Ice King?
Jake:  Hold on to me, bro!
Finn:  No! Wait, we forgot... BMO!
BMO:  Goodbye, boys! It's better this way!
[Beeping]
Princess Bubblegum:  [sighs] Oh, well. They'll be back. [snaps] They have nowhere else to go.

[Scene changes to Cloud Kingdom. Finn and Jake land safely.]
Finn and Jake:  [both screaming]
Jake:  Yah! Ooh! [groans]
Finn:  Are we in...
Ice King:  Cloud Kingdom. Looks like we got away before the candy curse became permanent.
Jake:  That's right. My skyhooks saved the day.
Finn:  Thanks for getting us out of there, Simon.
Ice King:  Aw, I can't take all the credit. It's all thanks to my skyhooks.
Jake:  Hey, why are you even up here?
Ice King:  We live here now, me and the skyhooks.
Jake:  Finn, you gotta see this.
Finn:  [gasps] Oh... my...
Jake:  but...
Ice King:  Skyhooks!
Jake:  Dang.
Finn:  What in Grod's name am I looking at?
Ice King:  Fire, ice, candy, and slime.
Jake:  Weird. How did this happen, Ice King?
Ice King:  Look, I know it's a lot to take in. Let's go to the living room.
[Whoosh]
Ice King:  Now settle in, get comfortable, 'cause I am gonna tell you everything. And it is going to blow your... Oop! I gotta kiss my skyhooks good night. Good night, my skookie-wooks. [kisses] Okay.
Jake:  Dude...
Finn:  Why does it look like a four-way pizza?! Is everyone in Ooo like a zombie? Is everyone basically dead?
Ice King:  Everyone is not dead. It's much worse. Let me start at the beginning.

[Flashback begins. Ice King sits alone in his ice castle after Finn, Jake, and BMO left for the Islands.]
Ice King:  No. What am I gonna do without my besties around? Mm. ♪ Mm, okay. Bird watching sounds cool.
Betty:  Hey, roomie! I'm going out to pick up some magic ingredients.
Ice King:  Ooh! Are you making somethin' delicious?
Betty:  Oh, I'm building a magic battery to power my elemental purification spell.
Ice King:  Cool. Bring me a snackie.
Betty:  Like... a doughnut?
Ice King:  Surprise me.
Betty:  Oh, I'll surprise you. [under breath] I'll surprise everyone.
Jake:  Wait. What was Patience talking about?
Ice King:  Oh, it's not important. Something ominous. Anyways, it was then that I really got into bird watching. ♪ What else we got here? A penguin.
Gunter:  Oh. Right.
Ice King:  [gasps] Something! Is that... Oh... my... glaah!
Betty:  [gasps] You a toucan?
Ice King:  Simon, I've been trying so hard to help you. I've tried reprogramming... nnn your... your crown, Code-mapping, penguin-napping, co-mingling with magic, and grasping and grappling, but it just hasn't been happening. It's saddening, it's maddening, and I'm rapping and... and... [inhales deeply]
Betty:  [inhales]
Ice King:  So I'm trying the direct approach.
Betty:  Ugh.
Gunter:  Wenk!
Betty:  No, I don't remember who she is, but I know how to find out.
Ice King:  Hey! So good to see you! You still working at that same place?
Betty:  Mm, my work takes me all over.
Ice King:  I meant all over the place.
Betty:  Oh! Before I forget, I just got a new phone. Would you mind reentering your info for me?
Ice King:  It's okay. I know you don't remember me.
Betty:  No, no, no. I can get this. [inhales slowly, pfft!] I lost it.
Ice King:  A long time ago, you and I were... colleagues. My name is Betty Grof, and...
Betty:  That's what I was gonna say! Betty! [inhales] Hey, do you wanna go on a date with me tonight?
Ice King:  [babbles] Uh, buh, buh, buh.
Betty:  Yes. Meet me at 8:00 at my Magic Man House.
[Laughing]

[Flashback continues. Ice King calls Jake on the phone.]
Ice King:  ♪
[Ring]
Jake:  Hello?
Ice King:  You are not gonna believe what just happened.
Jake:  What?
Ice King:  A lady touched me!
Jake:  That's cool. Who is she?
Ice King:  I think she might be an exotic bird. But guess who's going on a date tonight!
Jake:  Wow. So what are you gonna wear?
Ice King:  Oh, probably my go-to... blue muumuu.
Jake:  Ugh! No! You need to get a nice bespoked suit.
Ice King:  A be-wudda-wa?
Jake:  "Bespoke" means it's custom-made to fit your specific dimensions and emphasize what's flattering about your shape.
Ice King:  Like my abs.
Jake:  No, I'd say you're kinda bottom-heavy.
Ice King:  No, that's just the muumuu, dawg. I'm jacked.
Jake:  Hmm.
Ice King:  Oh, yeah. What the heck d...
Jake:  Shh!

[Flashback continues. Ice King and Jake go suit shopping.]
Ice King:  'Kay, so then we went suit shopping.
Jake:  It's very important to pick a good, natural fabric. As for color, for a first suit, you should choose between black, navy, or charcoal grey.
Ice King:  Why?
Jake:  It's a wizard fashion rule. If you stray, you'll look like a fool.
Ice King:  How's about if I make my suit a onesie?
[Smack]
Ice King:  Ow!
Jake:  Whoa. Let's get to work!
Ice King:  ♪ And then Life-Giving Magus checked an even darker... [whispers] shade of gray against my face. Until finally...
Life-Giving Magus:  Yep! Pretty fly for an ice guy.
Ice King:  ♪

[Flashback continues. Ice King arrives at Betty's house for the date.]
Door:  [singsongy] Ding dong! Someone's here!
Ice King:  That's clever.
Betty:  Hello, Simon.
Ice King:  Uh, flowers. Come in. Come in.
Betty:  I really like how you decorated the place. I'm really into skulls and old teeth in jars, too. Ready for our date?
Ice King:  You bet. Bah-bam!
Betty:  Aaaaah! [pants]
Ice King:  This a-way.
Betty:  What is this place?
Ice King:  In the old days, we would meet here, and you would give me books because you had a subscription to the Book a Day Club.
Betty:  Book a Day?
Ice King:  You gave me the excess books because I was associated with Books for the Bookless.
Betty:  [laughs] Simon!
Bogo:  You want your usual booth?
Betty:  Bogo! You remember him?
Ice King:  Lead the way, Bogo!
Betty:  So...
Ice King:  Yes?
Betty:  Are we going splitsies?
Ice King:  [sighs] Okay, I'll pay for half your entrée. But if you get an appy or a dessert, it's on you.
Ice King:  Mmm, mmm, mmm! [smacks lips]
Betty:  [inhaling deeply] Aah!
Ice King:  What? There something in my beard?
Betty:  You don't remember any of this?
Ice King:  [thinking] She's starting to freak me out.
Ice King:  Ring, ring! Sorry. I should take this. Oh, hi, Gunter. No. I'm on my date.
Betty:  [inhaling deeply]
Ice King:  Gunter, I have to go.
[Chomping]
Ice King:  Technology, right? [chuckles]
Betty:  Aah! No!
[Zapping]
Betty:  It's all wrong! Ugh! Zap! Wha?
[Whoosh]

[Flashback continues. Betty talks to Tiny Manticore.]
Betty:  Well, that was terrifying. I've tried everything I can think of to make Simon remember. Is there something I'm missing? What am I doing wrong?
Tiny Manticore:  Maybe you're going after someone who doesn't exist anymore. Why not take him as he is? After all, you've been through a lot of changes yourself.
Betty:  You're making a lot of sense, Tiny Manticore. We're like two shadows, two ghosts caught in limbo.
Tiny Manticore:  It sounds depressing when you say it that way.
Betty:  Think of a different way to say it.
[Crying softly, sighs heavily]

[Flashback continues. Ice King returns to his ice castle with Gunter.]
Gunter:  Wenk.
Ice King:  Oh, uh, just stretching.
Gunter:  Wenk?
Ice King:  The date? Uh, yeah, it went great. I don't know about a second date, though. I don't wanna be that guy who just hangs out with his girlfriend all the time and doesn't see his friends.
Jake:  Man, I wanna be that guy so bad.
[Whoosh]
Betty:  Hey, I was just talking about you to my penguin. Have you met Gunter?
Ice King:  Yes. I kidnapped him that one time.
Betty:  Look, Simon... I mean, Ice King.
Ice King:  Yeah, who's this Simon guy you keep yakking about? Should I be jealous?
Betty:  He's somebody I knew a long time ago.
Ice King:  Hey, you still into bird watching? Watch this.
[Electricity crackles]
Ice King:  Mmm... zow!
[Birds chirping]
Betty:  [laughs] Amazing! [laughs] Such beautiful birds!
Ice King:  They're all for you, Ice King.
Betty:  Woof. What a bust. These are some low-grade fairies.
Patience:  My magic battery is going to su... Who's this dancing with the I.K.?
[Electricity crackles]
Ice King:  Bird friend! [laughs] How delightful.
[Laughing]
Ice King:  Ha! [sighs] Huh? Where did the weird lady go?
Patience:  Uh... well, when you weren't looking, her... her mom showed up and told her that her old boyfriend wanted to be with her again, and they ran off together. The end.
Ice King:  Her mom? Well, I gotta go.
Patience:  I almost forgot! Surprise!
[Crying, chewing]
Ice King:  [groans]

[Flashback continues. Ice King returns to his castle and discovers Patience's plan.]
Ice King:  I wonder if my roomie has any more of these soothing doughnuts. Only one way to find out! ♪
Patience:  Elemental, elemental. Stand, do not sit.
Ice King:  Cool.
Patience:  Elemental, Elemental. Can not quit.
Ice King:  Weird Lady!
Patience:  Blast him!
Ice King:  [humming] Eee.
[Zaps]

[Scene changes back to present day in Cloud Kingdom.]
Ice King:  Then everything went nuts. There was all this light and noise. I grabbed as many penguins as I could... one.
Finn:  But now that you're here, we can go back and save Weird Lady.
Jake:  Sounds like we got our first lead.
Finn:  All we needed was... a little patience.
