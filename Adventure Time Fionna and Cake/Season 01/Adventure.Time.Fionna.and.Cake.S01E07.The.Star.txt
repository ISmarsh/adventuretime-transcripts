Marceline:  Hmm.

Fionna:  Nothing's gonna top that universe.

Cake:  Best nap of my life.

The Lich:  Your pocket's smoking.

Oh! Ooh!

Cake:  Fionna?

Cake:  What's the matter?

Cake:  You still pouting about that winter fling?

Fionna:  Okay... real talk.

Cake:  That frosty biscuit was stone-cold nasty.

Cake:  He deserved exactly what he got.

Fionna:  What about all those candy people?

Fionna:  Did they deserve to be chopped up?

Cake:  That was self-defense.

Fionna:  I still feel bad, okay?

Fionna:  I wanna make things better, not worse.

Cake:  You will.

Once we get the crown, we'll change everything.

We can't make this world any worse.

Fionna:  Bad news, gang. The jewel's magic is depleting.

It might only be good for one more crown-dimension jump.

So we gotta make this world count.

We should go now.

Cake:  Weren't you listenin'?

Vampires! Run!

Fionna:  Cake!

Cake:  Kill!

Cake:  Ha! Not so tough.

Fionna:  Stay down.

Cake:  We need to fashion some rudimentary stakes.

Fionna:  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

Cake:  Fionna?

Fionna:  Incoming!

Huh?

Cake:  Fionna, stab it in the heart!

Fionna:  Ow! In the heart!

Fionna:  It's a lot harder in real life.

Cake:  That's it.

Fionna:  Aah!

Cake:  That was awesome.

Fionna:  I almost got ate. This world is scary.

It reminds me of the Wastelands of Ooo,

before Marceline took on the vampires there.

Cake:  Let's poof these suckers.

Fionna:  Aah!

Fionna:  Cake!

Cake:  No!

Vampire:  Yow-ow-l.

Cake:  Holy water.

Vampire:  Show me them teeth.

Cake:  No vamps. Just dum-dums, ma'am.

Princess Bubblegum:  You left yourself vulnerable out there.

Vampire:  Buncha death wishers.

Fionna:  Princess Bubblegum?

Cake:  Thanks for saving... - Strange cat mutant,

Princess Bubblegum:  I saw how you chomped those vamp heads.

Fionna:  Impressive. Oh, that?

Cake:  Easy greasy, baby.

Cake:  The name's Cake.

Princess Bubblegum:  Bonnie. My team is on an urgent mission, and I could really use your murder skills.

Cake:  Sorry, lady, but I got my own mission to think about.

Princess Bubblegum:  We're looking for a magic crown. Maybe you've seen it?

Princess Bubblegum:  Seems our interests coincide after all.

Fionna:  The Vampire King has the crown.

Vampire King?

Princess Bubblegum:  He uses it to summon clouds and keep the sky perpetually dark.

Princess Bubblegum:  And vampire-friendly.

Fionna:  I'm gonna slay him or die trying.

Cake:  Now, that is a party I don't wanna miss.

Princess Bubblegum:  And when you're done with that, we can get the crown?

Vampire King:  Sure. Let's get off the street, blood bags.

Huh.

Princess Bubblegum:  I don't remember this part of downtown being so... gothic.

Fionna:  You've been quiet tonight.

Fionna:  Ugh, I just gotta steel myself before I see my mom.

Cake:  Hey, I got your back.

Vampire King:  Tank, autopilot.

Vampire King:  Navigation and artillery are up here, sleeping tubes, armory, and the rest is a combination war room, rec room, and mess hall.

Vampire King:  Tank, gimme the usual.

Vampire King:  This is my team.

Vampire King:  Huntress, our expert marksman and survivalist.

Vampire King:  And that's our munitions expert, Martin Mertens.

Vampire King:  And soup expert.

Fionna:  So what's the plan? Simple.

Fionna:  Infiltrate the hive, get past hundreds of vampire minions.

Cake:  Hundreds? They're low-level threats.

Fionna:  We can deal with them easily...

Vampire King:  with these.

Vampire King:  Garlic bombs.

Cake:  I call them garbos.

Vampire King:  What we really have to look out for is the Star.

Fionna:  The Star?

Vampire King:  The Vampire King's ward. Vicious. Merciless.

Vampire King:  The Star has outlived the rest of his inner circle.

Vampire King:  Trained by the V.K. himself.

Fionna:  I've got a score to settle with the Star.

Cake:  I live for this biz.

Getcher beans and cabbage.

Beans!
Beans!

Thank you, Martin.

Huh?

Beans.

Oh no.

Awww. Babyworld Finn.

How could you bring a child into this world?

It was an accident.

He must've crawled in during nap time.

Wanna get in on this?

Cool hat.

Oh, I love this little guy.

Curses. Where are they?

Ugh, stop.

Scrabby, that's the second alert today.

If you let me out, I could easily

just zap everything back to normal.

Shut up. I can solve this.

Yeah, your plan of chasing them

all over the vast multiverse is a real winner.

I've been chasing the wrong thing.

If I get to the crown in this world first,

I can wait for them to come to me.

Well, crap.

Thanks for the idea.

Ugh, leave me alone.

Hey, uh, you should really answer that.

I speak from experience.

Ha! Gotcha.

Wait. No. Not now.

Ooh, Scrabby, ya burnt.

Mom?

Darling, you're here.

Gary:  Mom, this is Gary. Is that what you're wearing?

Your suit is pressed and waiting in your room, sweetheart.

Ugh, do I have to? And, young man,

Marshall has extra suits that should fit you.

Oh, thank you, Ms. Abadeer.

Marshall didn't say it was gonna be this fancy.

Gary:  I'm Gary, by the way.

Ah, yes, yes, yes. Graby.

The little baker-entrepreneur friend.

You know about that?

Come on, I'll show you to my room.

I can't believe you live in such a swanky place.

I used to live here.

Okay, but could an acorn kill a vampire? Whatchamean?

Like, if you planted it in their chest

and waited for it to grow into a tree? Yes.

What about a pinecone?
Don't touch that.

Fionna:  What if a vampire gets a tiny splinter and it travels into his bloodstream all the way to his heart?

Cake:  Yeah, dude. I've done it.

Fionna:  Proximity alert, ma'am.

Cake:  Show me.

Fionna:  Help! Help us!
Fionna:  Help! Help us!

Help us! Please!
Please! help us!

Fionna:  We're stranded! Help!
Cake:  We're stranded! Oh, no!

Cake:  Quick, pull over.

No distractions.

Fionna:  But you stopped for us.

I stopped for your mutant cat.

Big picture.

I'm helping them.

Cake:  Hey!

Fionna:  I've never been a big-picture person.

Bonnie:  Dillweed.

Fionna:  Come on, Bonnie.

Tank:  Tank, halt.

Fionna:  Help! Help us!
Fionna:  Help! Help! Help us!

Cake:  Help! Help! - Help! Help! Help us.

Bonnie:  Fionna, stop. Teeth. Teeth.

Clear!

Huntress Wizard:  Come with us.

Run!

Huntress Wizard:  Tank, back up!

Fionna:  Thanks.

Bonnie:  Like I always say, pay it forward.

Marceline:  Did you like my welcome?

Cake:  It's the Star.

Marceline.

Pardon.

Marceline:  Martin.

Marceline:  Don't you look tasty.

Bonnie:  Open fire!

Cake:  Fionna!

Bonnie:  Main cannon, fire! Fire! Fire!

Marceline:  Bonnibel, I think there's something wrong with your tank.

Marceline:  I'll have your heart!

Loser!

Fionna:  I'm not a loser!

Bonnie:  Tank, estimate repair time.

Tank:  Processing.

Tank:  16 hours, 43 minutes, ma'am.

Marceline:  Quatsch!

Cake:  Ow, ma'am.

Marceline:  Bonnie, perhaps I can help.

Marceline:  I may not look it, but I'm quite the Mr. Fix-It.

Bonnie:  How do you know the Star's true name?

Bonnie:  Are you her spy?

Fionna:  Leave him alone. And watch the baby.

Marceline:  I'm from another world with another Marcy.

Marceline:  I found her in the rubble and raised her as my own.

Marceline:  My Marceline became a great vampire hunter.

Marceline:  And where I come from, you two fell in love.

Bonnie:  I would never.

Fionna:  I'm really sorry about Martin.

Bonnie:  You should be.

Bonnie:  It's your fault I'm down one man.

Bonnie:  And, more importantly, one tank.

Fionna:  Wait.

Cake:  I'm your tank.

Bonnie:  That could work.

Fionna:  Cake, there are other magic crowns out there.

Cake:  What?

Bonnie:  It's just... you could get hurt.

Simon:  Simon says we're running out of jumps.

Fionna:  We could get stuck someplace even worse.

Cake:  Fionna, I can do this.

Bonnie:  Well, you're not going without me.

Fionna:  Bonnie, let me take Martin's place.

Blonde woman (wealthy guest):  This pâté is too moussey.

Second blonde woman (wealthy guest):  Not moussey enough!

Fionna:  This room is filled with tastemakers, powerbrokers, and every big investor in the city.

Cake:  Yeah, it sucks.

Cake:  But you should enjoy yourself.

Fionna:  Oh.

Bonnie:  Mmm! This red velvet cake is phenomenal.

Bonnie:  I'm going to go out on a limb and say, mayonnaise?

Chef:  Why, yes. Nobody has guessed that.

Chef:  I'm working on perfecting a red velvet cake myself, named Mr. Velvet.

Bonnie:  Yeah?

Bonnie:  Yeah, he's a sensitive little guy.

Chef:  All of my pastries have personalities and backstories.

Chef:  Maybe that's stupid, but...

Bonnie:  No, I'm intrigued.

Old Man:  Tell me more about the tasty velvet man.

Chef:  Uh, okay.

Chef:  Um, so Mr. Velvet was once a high-powered attorney.

Old man:  Ah. I'm a high-powered attorney. I relate to this character.

Chef:  So, yeah, he's an attorney who quit his job...

Bonnie:  Really, Marshall, you don't think of anyone but yourself.

Bonnie:  Because he felt too stifled... We've all humored you long enough, but you're not a rock star. with all the expectations.

Old man:  That's so interesting.

Old man:  I gotta introduce you to Marjoe.

Old man:  He's a fabulously rich epicure, and he loves visionaries.

Gary:  Hi. I'm Gary.

Do you think baby Finn will be okay?

Old man:  Excellent form, young man.

Fionna:  Aah!

No sign of vamps.

Ha. They think we're stuck miles from here.

We've got almost one hour till sundown.

Here's the hive.

We'll split into three teams to make the drop.

Cake and I will hit from the East.

Marjoe:  Huntress, you take the North.

Marjoe:  Fionna and Simon, you enter from the West.

Marjoe:  Oh, and then I ripped out his throat and drank him dry.

Marjoe:  And I wasn't even hungry.

Marjoe:  You should have seen it, minions.

Marjoe:  The look on Bonnie's face was so funny.

Good one, highness. Stupid gum witch. Ow!

Dad says we can't underestimate her.

Such a nuisance. Why don't you kill her already?

Are you questioning me?

Cake:  No, of course not.

Fionna:  Good. Dad wouldn't like that.

Marjoe:  Right?

Fionna:  Aah!

Fionna:  She's flippin' nuts.

Cake:  How did little Marcy turn into that?

Fionna:  Maybe in this world she didn't have a you.

Cake:  She didn't have a me.

Fionna:  Let's finish the drop.

And each drop would include different characters

Marceline:  until there's a whole kingdom of pastry menschen.

Pink-haired character (Prince Gumball):  Ha. I love it. It's dripping with sentimentality.

Marceline:  Heh, thanks.

White-haired character in red suit:  We've had a lot of fun tonight, talking about blood.

White-haired character in red suit:  But all too seldom do we talk about the blood relationship of mother and son.

White-haired character in red suit:  Marshall has always had a rebellious streak.

White-haired character in red suit:  You might even say he fancies himself as "hot blooded."

Fionna:  Oh.

Delightful. More of this.

But it turns out that boys need their mothers after all.

Please don't.

White-haired character in red suit:  Imagine my surprise when he came to me and asked for re-entry into my world through the kind attention of the Lemoncarbs.

White-haired character in red suit:  I'd like to thank them for that favor.

You're not welcome. Never again!

Oh, no, Marshall, you didn't.

Good hole, Cake.

Lemongrabs:  All our garbos are planted.

Lemongrabs:  Setting the bomb timer... now.

Fionna:  Huntress will infiltrate the throne room.

Fionna:  When the bombs go off, she'll shoot the Vampire King's crown right off his head.

Fionna:  The ice-magic-created clouds will clear, and, finally, all the vampires driven out of the hive by garlic smoke will burn up in the daylight.

Cake:  Uh, maybe we should workshop this plan.

Fionna:  We did it!

Cake:  Yay! Yay!

Fionna:  No. Something's wrong. The sky's still cloudy.

Nice try, meat.

Star.

Cake:  Oh, I'm so happy our little artiste

is finally ready to get serious

and join the family business.

Isn't that right, Marshall?

Fionna:  You owe me.

Cake:  Um, yeah. Maybe.

Mmm. Yes, I think you have something very marketable here.

We should definitely set up a meeting.

Fionna:  V.K., give us the crown, or I'll scratch you up.

Agents of light...

Cake:  try summa these.

Fionna:  Aah!

The Lich King:  It's funny.

The Lich King:  I don't even need this gaudy thing to be powerful, but I like going outside anytime I want.

Fionna:  I'm gonna stab your butt!

The Lich King:  Try it, dweeb.

Daughter. Yeah, Dad?

Stop toying with your prey and finish her off.

Or toy with her in a more creative way.

The Lich King:  Make it interesting.

Simon Petrikov:  Vampire King, you're a bad dad.

We can forgive youthful mistakes

and years and years of embarrassing decisions.

Can't we, everyone?

The Lich King:  Baby, tell the people how grateful you are.

Simon Petrikov:  Ms. Abadeer, you're a bad mom.

Do something about your excitable little friend.

Marceline:  Gary you don't know how powerful she is.

You'll be blackballed by everyone here.

Fionna:  I don't care.

Marceline:  You deserve better than anything that creep could do for me.

Well.

Fionna:  I'm gonna suck out your other eyeball.

Fionna:  Choke on it.

Marceline:  It'd be so easy to stake you.

Oh-ho!

Cake:  Uh, we should bail.

Fionna:  Wait.

Marceline:  Ha-ha. Good hit, honey.

Fionna:  He's distracted.

Fionna:  Cake, no.

Cake:  Fionna. No, no, let me go.

Cake:  Let's zap away now. No, I got this.

Marceline:  I see what you're tryin' to do.

Fionna:  Be careful. The remote.

Cake:  Please, you're gonna...

Fionna:  Aah!

Marceline:  Eh?

Cake:  Hmm. Does kitty want attention?

Does she also seek annihilation?

Marceline:  You're kind of hot, but you have chicken feet.

Grab on.

Marceline:  Ooh, I've seen a new thing.

Marceline:  Bonnie, you know, you could join me.

Princess Bubblegum:  What's the point?

Marceline:  The population's crashed, and you're running out of food.

Marceline:  Laughing all the way while the world goes down in flames.

Princess Bubblegum:  Dum-dum.

Marceline:  Baby girl.

Princess Bubblegum:  If you poof me, you'll die, too.

Princess Bubblegum:  Together, then.

Princess Bubblegum:  Marshall!
