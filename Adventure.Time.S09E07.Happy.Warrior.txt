Finn: [brandishing the fire sword and feeling it's power course through him] Cool.

[ Distant grunting and fighting sounds ]

Fire Kingdom Citizen: Your cooking stinks! Aah!

Second Citizen: [screaming] So sick of your face!

[ Distant screaming ]

Finn: Lady Raini‐‐ er, Flameicorn! It's me ‐‐ Finn! I got important news about Jake‐‐[Lady Flameicorn violently swats Finn into a tree] Oof!

Finn: [with rising anger] Get out of my way, Lady. I'm gonna get the Fire jewel even if I have to put you in the ground! [Finn is briefly overcome by elemental fire magic, but calms down.]

Finn: [ Groans ] No, we're not gonna fight you.

LSP: [suddenly attacks Lady Flameicorn] Aah! Step off, Lady! I'm fighting you!

Gunter: [to Finn] Wenk, wenk.

Finn: I can't--She's like family!

Gunter: [moves in to assist LSP] Wenk!

Cinnamon Bun: It's no use, Finn. Like all of the fire people, Lady Flamicorn knows only fighting.

Finn: Cinnamon Bun! You're still normal.

Cinnamon Bun: My Flame shield protected me from the change, but the rest of the kingdom...is lost.

Finn: Not for long, man. Will you take us to Flame Princess? 

Cinnamon Bun: It won't do any good. She is spicy with anger.

Finn: I know I can reason with her. We used to really bond over music and...stuff.

[Cinnamon Bun shakes his head in disbelief, but he lowers his steed,Jake 2, so the trio can climb on.]

LSP: Comin' in. [Nuzzles into Cinnamon Bun's back] Mmm.

Cinnamon Bun: [slightly shocked] Wha--? Mm.

[ Distant barking ]

Finn: [ Gasps ] That was the throne room.

Cinnamon Bun: This is as far as I go.

Finn: Don't you want to see FP?

Cinnamon Bun: She said some...hurtful things.

Finn: I'll give her a good talking to...[again, Finn is briefly overcome with Fire Elemental magic] I'll talk her into next week!

Cinnamon Bun: [fiercely] No! I'm gonna let her do her. I'm a loner now.

LSP: What about your wolf friend?

Cinnamon Bun: My wolf is also a loner. We are both loners!

LSP: [as Cinnamon Bun and Jake 2 ride away] When did he get cool? Everyone slept on that.

Finn! The duck found a secret tunnel!

Okay. [Sighs]

Wenk, wenk, wenk.

So, are you still into Flame Princess?

What? No, FP and I are just friends.

And I'm really proud of that friendship.

Getting there took a lot of trust building and emotional growth.

Okay. I believe you.

Do you do squats?

Gunter?

Dang. Just look at these ding‐dongs.

[Swords clashing, shouting]
