[The episode begins in a post-apocalyptic world. A baby cries while people hide from a figure on horseback.]
[Wind whistling softly]
[Crying]
Woman:  ♪ Hush, now, hush don't cry little one ♪ ♪ Please don't you cry or the Snowman will come ♪
Man:  Keep him quiet!
Woman:  You keep quiet!
[Crying continues]
[Exhales]
Man:  The Snowman!
[Neighing]
[Ice Finn cackling]
[Wind whistling]

[Scene changes to Fionna, Cake, and Simon discussing Simon's plan.]
Simon:  If you think about it it's the perfect solution. As Ice King I'll be powerful enough to fend off this scarab person who's after us. I'll be immortal so your universe will last forever instead of dying with me. And finally, I'll be magic again ergo magic will be restored to your world just like you want.
Fionna:  Hmm. Sounds great! No downsides!
Cake:  Question, though.
Simon:  Yes?
Cake:  How do we get back inside your head after Fionna-world is cool again?
Simon:  I'll just re-create the same ritual that brought you here on accident, on purpose! But first, we need to find another magic crown somewhere in the multiverse. [yawns] Multiverse means multi-crowns to nab. It'll be easy as hunting down a mouse... in a, uh... a big ol'... pile of mice! We should start by searching this world... wherever we are. Let's get lookin'! Uh... oh.
[Snoring]
Cake:  Fionna?
Simon:  Yes! Finally.

[Fionna sleeps while Simon examines the remote.]
Cake:  Should you be messing with that?
Simon:  We need to know what we're dealing with here.
Fionna:  [waking up] Hey. Was I out long?
Cake:  Oh, you're up! I got you something to eat.
Simon:  Huh? Wuh! Waaahh! Blech!
Fionna:  You love it. You love this. Let's find the nearest library. It could give us clues on where to begin looking for the crown.
Fionna:  To the library!
Cake:  Ha! Fionna's a turbonerd!
Fionna:  Wait, no! I take it back!
[Fionna laughing]
Simon:  Ugh. Huh...
[Flies buzzing]
Simon:  [sniffs] Okay, this is really starting to smell. Hold this for me?
Fionna:  Any excuse to be more naked.
Simon:  Don't make it weird.
Fionna:  No, I respect it!
Cake:  Looks like we're going the right way. Oh! Sweet! Road loot! Oh! Ooh. Whoa! A real Vespucci! I could never afford one of these back home.
Fionna:  That's ugly. I want it!
Simon:  You both look kind of conspicuous. We should keep a low profile until we know what's what.
Cake:  Relax, dude. I've played a lot of post-apocalyptic RPGs. The more loot, the better. Let's keep moving.
Fionna:  Lighten up, man. If the bug guy hasn't caught us by now, maybe he gave up!
[Scarab clicks tongue]

[Meanwhile, the Scarab holds Prismo captive in the Time Room.]
Prismo:  [laughs]
Scarab:  Something funny?
Prismo:  Nothing... It's just, good luck working the TV wall without the remote. Ha ha ha!
Scarab:  [grunts]
[Ice clinking]
[Clucking]

[Scene changes to the wasteland market.]
Vendor:  Tires... They're round, they're rubber! Get 'em here!
[Chains clinking]
Simon:  [coughing] I feel right at home!
Fionna:  You're the one who's conspicuous here.
Cake:  Yeah, man, you stick out like a sore thumb!
Citizen:  The cat talked! It must be magic!
Citizen 2:  Ha, everybody knows there's been no magic since the days of the Snowman.
Cake:  [hisses]
Citizen:  Aah!
Fionna:  Cake! Act like a normal cat!
Cake:  Fine. Meow... Is this what you want?
Simon:  Hey, a library! Oh, thank goodness!
[Glass shatters]
[Indistinct conversations]

[Inside the library, a funeral is taking place.]
Tromo:  Listen up, rabble! We're 'bout to get this funeral started. So shut up and pay respects! Introducing the savior of the wastelands and defeater of the Snowman Big Destiny! Today, sadness is not allowed. Today we party for the dead body of Popcorn!
Crowd:  Whooo!
Man:  Old Man Popcorn finally croak?
Tromo:  Popcorn was a bomb warlord the last of his tribe! He died doing what he loved trying to ride alligator like horse!
[Cheers and applause]
Fionna:  Popcorn seemed cool.
Tromo:  Enjoy the sky arena! Fight big ghosts and win, Popcorn!
Crowd:  Popcorn... Popcorn...
Tromo:  Funeral over! All Popcorn gang territory goes to Destiny gang.
Reindeer Boy:  Uhhh, everyone here knows Popcorn signed a treaty on his deathbed making all the territory from the creek to the end of the great ditch the domain of the Reindeer Boys.
Big Destiny:  Anybody else?
Crowd:  Destiny gang rules!
Simon:  [gulp!]
Big Destiny:  That's how you do it my little Destiny. No speeches, just strong punching!
Fionna:  Like I said, low profile.
Cake:  Boring!
Simon:  Look... It's like I said. You gotta punch and push your way around to get what you want.
Fionna:  Hey, you!
Butcher:  Ohh!
Fionna:  What do you know about the magic crown?
Butcher:  Uhh!
Fionna:  Hey, you!
Fionna:  Aah! What do you know about a magic crown?
Butcher:  Please! I'm just a sweet butcher!
Cake:  Grrrr!

[A strange man approaches them with information about the crown.]
Strange Man:  I have the magic crown you seek. But the price I ask is very steep!
Simon:  Okay, weird man. Name your price.
Strange Man:  The crown is but the rarest of treasure. Present your wares and I'll take their measure.
Simon:  Uh, we should really verify it's the crown before we...
Fionna:  Nah... Oh, that's my phone.
Strange Man:  Hmm... A futuristic device? I think that's pretty nice!
Fionna:  Well, it's no good to me here anyway.
Strange Man:  It's got the worm game! Deal. [laughs] Here, m'dear!
Simon:  Is this the magic crown?
Strange Man:  No, that's trash. Give it back!
Simon:  No returns, fair is fair.
Cake:  [growls] You got burned and I don't care. You crook!
Strange Man:  Uhh...
Simon:  Whoo, Cake!
[Groaning]
Fionna:  [gasps] We gotta get out of here!
Cake:  Whoa!
[Both grunting]
Fionna:  [gasps] Magic fist!
Simon:  [sighs] Cake, you're too reckless!
Cake:  Ah, nobody saw that.
Peanut:  Magic cat! Ohh, I'ma eat that cat. Then when I get magic fist Daddy will have to make me gang leader!
Peanut:  Trauma Jon...
[Gasps]
Fionna:  Hey! Nobody eats Cake!
Fionna:  Heh heh. Uhh!
Peanut:  Stupid bunny. I'd cut your nose off but it looks like somebody beat me to it. Or maybe I'll take an ear instead.
Fionna:  Huh?
Little Destiny:  How about your nose, bully-boy?
Peanut:  No! Back off.
Little Destiny:  Little Destiny... You're a long way from home, Peanut.
Peanut:  Destiny gang gonna kick your...
Little Destiny:  Remember your place.
Peanut:  Ugh! I'ma gonna get so big! Then I'ma get you, too, L.D.!
Little Destiny:  [sighs] Now, what do I do with...
Simon:  [coughing]
Little Destiny:  Stay! Don't come here again, get it?
Simon:  [coughing]
Little Destiny:  Go!
Fionna:  Wake... up!
Peanut:  Huh? I'ma eat that cat!
Simon:  Who are you?
Little Destiny:  Shh. Not here.
[Groans]

[Little Destiny leads them to safety and reveals she knows about the crown.]
Little Destiny:  When I heard you talking about the crown I could tell you're new here. Locals don't like talking about magic.
Simon:  Do you?
Little Destiny:  Hard not to. My dad was the one who found the crown.
Simon:  What?
Simon:  Jay, I have to meet your dad.
Little Destiny:  Ha, where do you think we're going?
Cake:  Did you hear that, Fionna?
Simon:  He must be this world's version of me.
Little Destiny:  Watch your step.
[Ax chopping]
Jay:  Dad!
Simon:  Dang, apocalypse Simon is rugged.
Fionna:  No, that's Finn.
Cake:  Apocalypse you!
Fionna:  [gasps]
Finn:  You brought outsiders.
Jay:  Don't be mad. I know I'm not supposed to bring anyone home, but... they were in trouble.
Jay:  This is Fionna and Simon and this is Cake.
Cake:  Hello, handsome.
Finn:  Magic cat. I don't truck with magic you know that.
Jay:  Aw, she's okay, Pop! Peanut was gonna eat her! He swore he would!
Finn:  [sighs] I don't like you mixing it up with the Destiny gang. It's not our way.
Jay:  Yes, Dad.
Fionna:  Math.
Finn:  Y'all can stay here tonight. Kids, set the table for three more.
Kids:  Yes, Daddy.
Finn:  You too, Bonnie.
Bonnie:  But I'm scratching Jake!
Finn:  No buts.
Bonnie:  Fine.

[They have dinner at Finn's home.]
Finn:  Don't dither in the doorway. Sit down. Scootch.
Bonnie:  Dad, there's a cat at the table.
Finn:  The cat is also a guest.
Bonnie:  Oh. Hi, cat.
Cake:  Hey, cutie.
Bonnie:  It can talk!
Jay:  That's why they got chased by the Destiny gang.
Bonnie:  Whoa, really? That's so cool. Poor kitty. What do we do if the destiny gang comes here?
Finn:  I'll slay them if I have to.
Bonnie:  Ohh, I can't wait till I'm old enough to kill some jerks.
Finn:  Who wants soup?
[Warble]

[Meanwhile, the Scarab tracks them down.]
[Beeping]
[Sniffs, coughs]
Scarab:  Definitely Prismo.
Scarab:  You there... have you seen a group of travelers recently? Strange ones.
Strange Man:  I might feel smarter if you had something to barter.
Scarab:  I offer you your unmurdered life.
Strange Man:  Aaaaahh! Man, cat, and woman followed Jay Mertens west. I hope that answers your request.

[Back at Finn's home, they share soup and stories.]
Fionna:  [slurping] This soup's got such a deep flavor.
Finn:  It's been simmering for years. It's the soup mom was cooking the day she died. We just keep adding to it.
Simon:  Like a veritable soup of Theseus.
Finn:  No. My mom made it.
Simon:  No, see, because it's a reference to the famous thought experiment by British philosopher Thomas Hobbes...
Jake:  Don't tell anyone about this 'kay, dog?
Simon:  Only with soup parts instead of ship planks...
Finn:  Dude, what are you talking about?
Simon:  Cake?
Cake:  Yes?
Bonnie:  Can all kitties talk where you're from?
Cake:  No, but maybe they will once we find that magic crown and plop it on Simon.
Bonnie:  Wow! You're looking for a magic crown?
Simon:  That's actually why we're here.
Simon:  [clears throat] Jay tells us that you know something of its past and...
Finn:  You're a damn fool!
Cake:  Not cool, farm boy.
Finn:  You can sleep out in the hayloft. Be gone at first light.
Bonnie:  Now you two should kiss.

[That night, Jay sneaks out with Fionna, Cake, and Simon.]
[Insects chirping]
[Wind whistles softly]
[Snoring, mumbling]
Jay:  Ooh!
Jay:  Shh. My dad has ears like a bat.
Jay:  Fionna.
Fionna:  Wh... I'm up.
Jay:  I remembered something important. Dad doesn't speak of the crown but one time he drank cider that had gone hard and he let slip where he found it.
Fionna:  Oh!
Jay:  A big crater a few miles from here. Come on. I was heading to the crater anyway.
Bonnie:  Can I come?
Jay:  Bonnie! Please?

[Meanwhile, the Scarab arrives at Finn's home.]
[Fire crackling]
[Ice Finn cackling]
[Knock on door]
Scarab:  Good evening. Mr. Mertens, is it? Apologies for calling so late but I'm looking for some friends of mine. Perhaps you've seen them? An old man and a girl with a cat.
Finn:  Nobody's here but me and my kids.
Scarab:  Oh, I love children. Such a blessing. Well, I'd best continue my search then.
Finn:  Yeah, you'd best.
Scarab:  You have to bounce.
Bonnie:  [gasps] Phbt! Daddy! Jay took the magic kitty to the destiny crater and said I couldn't come! Then he stuffed me in the hay when I said I'd tattle!
Finn:  Get back in the house. Wake your siblings. Barricade the doors.

[At the crater, they search for the crown.]
Jay:  Hup. Oof!
Little Destiny:  This is the spot. Be quiet when you dig around for the crown, okay?
Simon:  I don't even know where to begin.
Cake:  Hey, Simon, what does it smell like? I can sniff it out with my cat senses.
Simon:  Huh. I guess I kinda associate it with the smell of freshly cut grass?
Cake:  Grass...
[Sniffing]
Fionna:  Work that thang!
Cake:  Hey, I think I got something! You guys go check it out. Imma go keep a lookout.
[Sniffing]
Fionna:  Under here.
Simon:  Good kitty!
[Both grunt]
Fionna:  That's not fair!
Simon:  Looks like the crown was annihilated by some very powerful magic... or something even worse.
Cake:  Aw, man. We'll have to try another universe.
Fionna:  Give it here!
Simon:  Let's think about this!
Fionna:  What's there to think about? There's squat for us here.
Cake:  Crap, it's that evil mullet kid!
Little Destiny:  Jay! Behind you!
Cake:  Run, kid!
Fionna:  Wha...
Simon:  What?
Little Destiny:  It's cool. She's with me.
Fionna:  Oh, I love a forbidden romance. I wanna hear how these two lovebugs got together. Tell us everything.
Jay:  [chuckles nervously] Well...

[Flashback to how Jay and Little Destiny met.]
Jay:  A couple months back after Dad spilled the beans I came here to see if I could find other cool stuff.
Past Jay:  Mathematical!
Peanut:  Hey, loser! This dirty hole is Destiny gang territory! Anything you find here is ours!
Past Little Destiny:  I found the most beautiful jewel here tonight. But I also found this old thing.
Past Little Destiny:  I'll let you go this time... but come back again and I gut you.
Jay:  And we've been secretly together ever since.
Fionna:  Enemies to lovers, my favorite.
[Coughing]
Jay:  Little Destiny!
Simon:  Uh-oh.
Little Destiny:  A twist!
Jay:  You feel cold again.
Little Destiny:  I've been searching for cures in the old library but I've had no luck so far.
Jay:  Help her, Simon, you're a doctor!
Simon:  I'm an antiquarian, damn it.
Fionna:  You should really tell your dad!
Little Destiny:  No. Being weak is not an option.

[Big Destiny and the gang arrive at the crater.]
Big Destiny:  That's right, my traitorous daughter! Weakness is worse than coughing death!
Peanut:  See? I told you. She's been doing mouth high fives with our enemies! Here's your reward!
Little Destiny:  Uhh!
Jay:  Aaah!
Cake:  Father of the year!
[Gang members growling]
Peanut:  Knife you!
Fionna:  Whaa... Aah!
Cake:  Eat paw!
Jay:  Aah! No!
Fionna:  You got Big D'd.
Little Destiny:  Jay!
Jay:  [grunts]
Jay:  Dad, let go!
Peanut:  Bro! What's this trash?
Little Destiny:  Jay gave it to me! We're in love!
Big Destiny:  Ha! Love is weak. But jewels are hot.
Simon:  [gasps] That's a piece of the magic crown! It's infused with ice magic! That's what's been making you sick!
Fionna:  Oh, no. Of course! Love-romance was just a play by this fart baby to take you down.
Jay:  [grunts]
Little Destiny:  Jay wouldn't do that.
Big Destiny:  Daughter prove that you're bigtime.
[Donkey brays]
Little Destiny:  Huh?
Finn:  Let them go.
Jay:  Dad, no!
Jay:  If you really believe I would hurt you... ugh... then do it, Little Destiny! Finish what you started on the most beautiful night of my life!
[Grunting, spits]
Cake:  I got it!
Big Destiny:  Waste this loser... with ruthless stabbing.
[Gang members chanting]
Gang:  Stab...
Little Destiny:  Aah!
Finn:  Huh?
Fionna:  One jewel.
Simon:  Good job, Cake!
[Scarab arrives]
Scarab:  Pardon my late arrival. I stopped to pick some wild fennel.
Cake:  Mother crud.
Peanut:  Uh, you got this, bro!
Finn:  Jay, get Little Destiny out of here.
Cake:  Aw, that was very sweet.
Finn:  Aaah!
Fionna:  Hit the button!
Cake:  Hit the button!
Simon:  Hit the button!
Fionna:  Hit the button!
