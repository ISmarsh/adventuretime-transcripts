BMO:  Oh...bananas.

Jake:  Bananas.

Jake:  BMO, it's your turn to say "bananas."

Joshua:  There is a strange cloud following us.

Joshua:  Come and see.

Jake:  I'm too comfortable to move.

Jake:  Can you just describe it?

BMO:  Forget the cloud.

Jake:  Tell us a story instead.

Joshua:  A nice campfire bedtime story.

BMO:  Once upon a time, there was this... cool guy and a banana with sunglasses.

Jake:  Please, no.

Joshua:  Literally anything but bananas.

BMO:  Once upon a time, there was a... bandana with sunglasses.

Jake:  Eh?

[Both snoring]

Jake:  Good night, bed.

BMO:  Good night, weird cloud.

Jake:  Good night, weird orb.

[Snoring]

BMO:  —Hey, Jake home.
[Applause]

Jake:  —Hey, Joshua home too!
[Applause]

Jake:  Whatcha doing, Dad?

Jake:  Scrambling eggs?

Joshua:  Yes, in the refrigerator!

[Laughter]

Jake:  Oh, boy.

Joshua:  I can see where this is going.

[Laughter]

Jake:  Man, that got old quick.

Jake:  What's going on here, Jermaine?

Joshua:  Wha —— wha —— what do you think?

Jake:  It's a dream, dum—dum.

Joshua:  Oh, right.

Jake:  ‘Cause dream bro times.

Joshua:  And ‘cause we burned this place down.

Jake:  Last year.

Joshua:  Anyway, what's up, Jermaine?

Jake:  Fine.

Joshua:  What do you think all these blank canvasses represent?

Jake:  These are, um, mine actually.

Jake:  I've really been getting into landscape painting.

Jake:  Mostly, like, forests and seascapes.

Jake:  Strictly representational art.

Joshua:  Dude, that's awesome!

Joshua:  We should collab on an interdisciplinary performance or something.

Jake:  Ah, that's not really my scene, man.

Jake:  I'm into real things.

[Snoring]

Finn:  I'm flying!

Jake:  No more walking for this guy.

Jake:  You hear that dudes?

Finn:  You're retired.

Jake:  Just gonna float around like a chubby bat.

Water Nymph:  Hey, Finn.

Water Nymph:  I made these cloud sculptures for you.

Finn:  Yes!

Jake:  Flying Finn will never miss out on anything.

Jake:  People will be all, “Too bad Finn's not here."

Finn:  And I‘ll be like, “Look up, surface dorks."

[Disco music plays]

BMO:  Director!

Where are your accessories?

Let‘s get the director's accessories, please?

BMO:  Okay, time for the show!

[Applause]

Jake:  We never have any fun when BMO's not here.

BMO:  All we do is hit things.

[Laughter]

BMO:  I love art.

Joshua:  Okay, boys, I got a job for you.

Joshua:  Think you can handle it? Of course you can.

Joshua:  Now, dig.

Jake:  Yeah, okay.

Jake:  Why are we doing this, Papa?

Joshua:  Never you mind!

Joshua:  Dig.

[Thumping]

[Sighing] Man, I'm out of shape.

Jake:  I can hear my own heart palpitating.

Jake:  Jeepers creepers.

Joshua:  Don't mind that. Just dig faster.

Joshua:  Dig faster, you dew droppers!

BMO:  Brrr!

Hey, it‘s PB.

Finn, what are you up to?

Oh, nothing. Just using my power of flight!

It's scientifically impossible for a human boy to fly.

You're gonna wish it was scientifically possible

Jake:  to put those words back in your mouth.

Finn:  Look!

Huuup!

Huuup! Grrr.

Huuup!

Stop holding me back!

[Thunder crashes]

BMO:  Huh?

Aah!

Finn, what are these?

Aaaaahhhh!

Jake:  I'm bored.

BMO:  I'm boring.

There's only one person who can save this play.

Yay, he's here!
Yay, he's here!

BMO! BMO!

[Applause] —A bootleg BMO?

BMO:  I'm bad!

But you still like me.

Boo!

This show is terrible!

I want to talk to the director.

The director is right this way, director.

Director, the director's here to see you.

Listen, the play started out good,

Jake:  but it didn't have any relatable characters.

[Gasping] Football!

AMO:  I'm not Football.

Jake:  Oh, good.

AMO:  I'm AMO!

Jake:  Oh, bad!

[Digging]

[Shovels clanging]

Jake:  The heck!

Jake:  Dad, the hole is gone!

Joshua:  -Boys? —Dad?

Joshua:  Boys, the hole is gone!

Joshua:  Looks like you buried me. Why‘d you do it?

Jake:  Aah! Dig! Aah! Dig!

BMO:  Mom. Mom.

Joshua:  What are you doing?

Water Nymph:  Mm.

Joshua:  I'm sure this is all really symbolic, but it‘s dang comfy.

[Gasping]

[Slurping]

Jake:  I don‘t like where this is headed.

Joshua:  I'm out of here.

BMO:  Ohhh.

Water Nymph:  Mom, Dad....

[Whimpering]

BMO:  How does it look?

Jake:  I think it looks cool.

Joshua:  Nice.

Water Nymph:  Oh!

J‘J‘

BMO:  What the plop?

Joshua:  Help...
Jake:  Jake?

Jake:  I'm aging up here!

Finn:  Okay, bird thoughts, Finn.

BMO:  Eggs, nest, wings, worms!

Jake:  Jake?

Finn:  Jake!

Jake:  Finn....

[Coughs]

Jake:  I'm old.

[BMO cries]

Jake:  Now it‘s too relatable!

BMO:  Cool, backup skin.

Aah!
Joshua:  That‘s not what I wrote!

BMO:  Huh?

Water Nymph:  I really respect that you do your own stunts.

Water Nymph:  You're brother's gonna have to step up his game to keep up with you.

Joshua:  We have to do something about these crow's—feet, or everyone's gonna know you're too old to play Jake.

Jake:  But I am Jake.

[Hissing]

Finn:  What's he saying?

BMO:  Your lines.

Jake:  Hss, hss, shss, shss. Hss, hss, shss, shss.

Joshua:  Uh, hss, sshs, hss.

Water Nymph:  Hss, hss, shss, shss.

Finn:  Just read the cue cards.

BMO:  It's just a rehearsal,

Jake:  but it‘s not okay to be really bad.

Finn:  BMO? What are you doing here?

Jake:  This is my nightmare!

No, this is my ——
No, this is my ——

Finn:  Oh, our nightmares, I guess.

Jake:  And you're here with us.

[Rumbling] —I am?

BMO:  The unconscious is so complicated.

Jake:  Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

Jake:  Bird thoughts!

Jake:  Perches, birdseed, hooting!

BMO:  It's not working!

Jake:  That weird eye cloud again.

Jake:  This fall‘s taking longer than I thought it would.

Jake:  I wish I had a game to pass the time while we're plunging to our death.

Jake:  Or, like, a puzzle or something.

BMO:  A puzzle.

Jake:  So what if I put this here?

Water Nymph:  Um...

J‘J‘

Jake:  Uh, who are you?

Jake:  Okay, you‘re some kind of nightmare princess.

BMO:  But where are we?

Jake:  We're dead. I knew it.

BMO:  I'm guessing we're still asleep on the boat.

BMO:  I think she entered our nightmares and mashed them up in order to communicate with us.

Jake:  What do you want to tell us?

Jake:  Banana?

[Gasps] She wants to hear my banana story!

[All gasp]

Water Nymph:  She's harvesting our mind—fruits!

Finn:  Wait, do you just want us to give you some bananas?

Joshua:  Well, there's loads on our boat. You can take as many as you ——

Jake:  No, Finn! You have to negotiate first.

Water Nymph:  We won't trade them for anything less than something pretty and/or cool.

Joshua:  Enjoy those bananas!

Water Nymph:  Pretty!

Finn:  What is this, like, nightmare juice?

Jake:  Let‘s drink it!

[Yawns] Hey, look how close to home we are.

Jake:  Land ho!

BMO:  Hm.

Joshua:  Mm—hmm.

Jake:  Yep.

Water Nymph:  Ooh, Ia—la.

Jake:  How‘s it look, BMO?

BMO:  Like a dream.
