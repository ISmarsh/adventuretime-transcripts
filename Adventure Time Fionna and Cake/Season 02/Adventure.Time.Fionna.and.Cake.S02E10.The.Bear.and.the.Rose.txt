[snapping]
Minerva:  Oh, dear.
[gasps]
Finn:  Everybody out of the pool.
[both] Thank you, Finn.
Finn:  No prob, Ro-Bob.
Finn:  How are you feeling now, Mom?
Minerva:  Loads better.
Minerva:  You're such a dear to pop over and deal with the Burger-mites.
Minerva:  Don't you agree?
Minerva:  Yes. He battles so handsomely.
Finn:  Anything to protect your data, Mom.
Minerva:  Hmm.
Minerva:  I've set you up with a date for Princess Bubblegum's Biennial Bubblegum Gumbo Gumboree.
Minerva:  And she's human, this time.
Minerva:  Definitely not Minervabot in a wig.
Finn:  I told you, I've already got a girlfriend.
Finn:  Kind of.
Minerva:  Of course. Huntress.
Minerva:  I've heard so much about this young lady, but I've never met her.
Finn:  She's just not very social.
Minerva:  I see.
Finn:  And she lives in different worlds sometimes, like higher planes of consciousness.
Finn:  And she doesn't have a phone.
Minerva:  I just don't want you to waste the good years of your life.
Minerva:  You deserve someone who wants to go out dancing and eat stew with you now.
Minerva:  I want you to be happy.
Finn:  You know, I can't even remember what gumbo tastes like.
Finn:  It's okay, Mom.
[water splashing]
Warrior:  Fight me for this land, Warrior!
[-[ululating] -Uh, time out--]
[opening theme music playing]
[low grunting]
Minerva:  My poor boy. Finn is one of a kind. He should be preserved at all costs. If only I had a copy of his living will. But I kept burning them.
Minervabots:  We located the techno-coffin.
[gasps]
Minervabots:  This way, Finn will lives forever, like me and Marcy. Nothing wrong with that. I don't know. Either we succeed and preserve some version of Finn, or we fail and put him out of his misery. Isn't that better than nothing? Yes. All right. Test one.
[loud thud]
Minervabots:  Seems good, yeah.
[all groaning]
Minervabots:  Send out word! This is Finn the human's last day!
[-Dang. -Yeah, this is crazy.]
[yelps]
Minervabots:  After all that work we did. It's just evil. What kind of a low down varmint could commit such a cruel act? Queenie. It had to be her. We can't prove it, though. We'll get proof. Uh... it wasn't Queenie. Fionna, Where have you been? I wrecked the place. I didn't mean to. I was just so angry, and I... but I'll do anything to make things okay. Please. I... You gotta try harder, dummy.
Hunter:  You could be way more angry. When I saw them kissing, it's like my mind went blank. [sighs] Fionna obviously still wants him. I don't think Fionna knows what she wants. And Phelix... he shouldn't have hurt you like that. No. But, I'm not sure if that's what really upset me. I really thought Fionna and I could have been... friends. But she just wanted him back. I don't know. Some things might not be so black and white. Hmm. Where's Gary and Marshall at?
Hunter:  Let's check the trailer.
[-[Fennel gasps] What? -[Hunter] Oh, my God!]
[Witch Wizard laughing]
Hunter:  Give up, twig-ass. [in sing-song voice] You're trapped! [in normal voice] We'll stay here and suckle on the green magic teat growing ripe with powe-- I already know another way to get out of here.
[creaking]
[-[gasps] -[yelps]]
Hunter:  New blood left itself wide open.
[both laughing]
Hunter:  You won't last long. This isn't right. Nope. Hmm.
Boy:  Mom? You came back! Crap.
[-[toy squeaking] -Huh?]
[gasping]
[grunts]
Boy:  I'm in Ooo!
[crowd cheering]
Princess Bubblegum:  Rejoice, Candy citizens. The champion of Slime Kingdom approaches.
[-[champion] What time is it? -[gasps]]
Princess Bubblegum:  Just a sec. Slime time! The slime is the best part, baby.
[yelps]
[-[gasps] -[laughing]]
Princess Bubblegum:  Staying here with me, after all? None of them landed in Ooo.
[laughing]
[all mummering, mourning]
Princess Bubblegum:  We're doing the right thing. There's only a slight possibility that if the upload fails, his soul will be trapped forever in limbo. That's cool. For the record, I'm firmly against this. Is this preserving him or insulting him? Insulting life itself? No offense. Announcement. Announcement. Announcement. This sad day would not be complete without Finn's closest family member...
[all gasp]
Princess Bubblegum:  Creator, your favorite son is here. Please eat something. Oh, my God! Is that Dutch apple?
[all cringe]
Princess Bubblegum:  Everyone, look here. Once Finn is uploaded, his mind will inhabit this brand new indestructible robot bod.
[-Sick. -[snaps]]
[yelps, crying]
Princess Bubblegum:  [grunts] Stupid. The heart was a conduit.
[grunts]
Princess Bubblegum:  But with my original body destroyed, I have no connection to Ooo anymore. You can tap into the heart. But I hate you. You need to connect through the Undergrowth. [scoffs] There's no point. You killed the heart. Can you feel its presence? Even a little? I told you, there's... Wait, there's something. Stay with it.
[heart beating]
Princess Bubblegum:  It's...

[both grunting]
[loud bang]
[yelps]
[all gasp in awe]
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn! Oh, no. Come on, come on. I need more life. Take mine! No.
[exhales deeply]
[straining]
Princess Bubblegum:  I told you guys.
[straining]
Princess Bubblegum:  Come on!
[straining]
Princess Bubblegum:  We're finally gonna be a family again.
[straining]
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh.
[breathes deeply]
[-[laughs] -[all rejoicing]]
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, Glob! I almost crushed him!
[-Hey, hey, hey. -[sobbing]]
Princess Bubblegum:  I think you need a break. Finn? Yeah, that soul is gone. The upload was interrupted. His consciousness isn't in the cloud!
[exhales deeply]
Princess Bubblegum:  All right, you win. "Breath work" is pretty good. Especially when you have six lungs.
Cake:  Ooh, don't give them away for free, baby.
[both laughing]
[sighs]
Cake:  No portal jumping, no drama, no trying to be something I'm not. I can just be. You know, you're welcome to stay here as long as you want. There's room for two in this pizza box. Really?
[-Any toppings I want? -[Huntress] Cake!]
Cake:  I need you to get a message to Fionna. Mmm. I'm sorry, but my girls need me. It's not all or nothing, Cake. Hold my spot. Fennel said she needed time to think. That seems bad. We really hurt her. Yeah. I've been pursuing you for the wrong reasons. Like I wanted to prove something or force a happy ending. But I don't think we're good for each other. You sure? I hate that I want you so much. Good luck, Phelix. I like the grass cape. Makes you look like a Samurai.
Cake:  Fionna! Cake. What's wrong? Finn needs you! What do I do? Uh... She said to get up in this dome and look for clues. Okay. Finn.
[grunts]
Cake:  I listen to my hero heart. Who are you? [echoes]
[thud]
[both groaning]
Cake:  [stuttering] Milady, to be smashed by such a beauty... an honor for Bellamy Bug. Sorry, I'm still new at this. This isn't Finn's mind. Gracious, no. This is Finn's imagination land. Still the daintiest part of that indelicate old brute. Can you help me find his mind room? I'd be delighted. Up, up, up. Close your eyes. Imagine you're walking straight ahead. Imagine you're running. Imagine you're paddling a canoe. And now imagine you're in Finn's mind room. Farewell.
[static]
[paper rustling]
Cake:  Finn? Finn?
[screaming]
Cake:  Ollie ollie oxen free! Found you. You want to be alone? No. You... You were the gut voice. There's a lot of people waiting for you up there. Then, why do I feel so dump trucks? No one loves me like Jake. Huntress loves you. She said that? Not with like, words. [sighs] She's such an idiot.
Finn:  She's a wise wizard. I'm a dumb baby man. [scoffs] The only dumb baby man here is me. And I've seen Huntress fight like hell to save you. I know she's as expressive as a tree stump, but underneath, she's as scared of messing up as anyone. Are you scared? Yeah, but mostly I think I need to chill my beans. Huntress made me realize I don't have to fix things. I just have to actually listen to my friends, to communicate better. And when it matters, show them I care. Huntress helped you communicate? I learned from her awful example. [chuckles] Yeah. Finn? Hi, babe. Did you do something with your hair?
[-[all rejoicing] -My babies.]
Finn:  Let's go! Yippie!
[crying]
[-[all rejoicing] -[gasps]]
Finn:  M-Cron? Hey, I'm sorry I ran off after we kissed. Your breath? Oh, no, you tasted like oats, baby. That's fine. It's just that I...
[sighs]
Finn:  I still really like you, but... but it didn't feel right for me. Also, I'm not a babe. Maybe not even a cat. I'm this. "You're magic." "Friends?" Aww! Friends. You're awesome.
[wind blowing]
Gary:  We'll hit the rest tomorrow. [sniffs] Hot dogs?
[plates rattling]
Gary:  Fionna? I climbed through the window. I made you dinner. Oh, Fionna... [sighs] I can see you're trying to make amends. It's just not enough. Oh. I understand.
Gary:  But, no one has made food for me in a long time. Yeah, I can't cook.
[muffled gasp]
Gary:  Wow, That's really bad.
[-[whimpers] -We'll bake together next time.]
[-Okay? -Next time?]
Gary:  [sniffles] Bubba, I'm so sorry. To both of you. I've been such a butt guy. I should have listened to you about your mom, Marshall. I didn't know how deep it went. We're all a bit messed up, Fi, but we don't have to fly solo. Yeah, I wish I'd gotten to hear your new songs, though. Well, actually, I've recorded a demo, if you're interested. Yes! You play!
[melodic guitar playing]
Huntress:  Natchy magic need not require exploitation, if you can shut your brain up enough to tap it.
[humming]
Huntress:  [scoffs] Why do wizards need gardening tips? This is good stuff. Come graduation, I got a kingdom to feed. Yo! Look at that beef slab. Huntress really juiced him up. Seriously. Finished, Papi. Hup! Ax mod.
[-It came to me in a dream. -[laughing]]
Huntress:  Beautiful. Why is he here? He's gonna blab all our gnostic secrets. The heart belongs to all of us. With these, we can suck someone's life juices or practice empathy. The straight line teaches the curve to bend. Yah!
Gary:  And remember, don't overmix your dough. Why? Your cookies will come out too hard. And the perfect pastry menschen is supposed to be soft and chewy.
[melodic music playing]
Gary:  Hey, Mr. Marshall.
[-Yeah? -Your music,]
Gary:  it makes me feel real good. Well, come jam with me. Hell, no, man!
[laughing]
[timer sounds]
[-[kid] How does he do that? -[kid 2] So cool!]
Gary:  Can I try? Press this button.
[-[farting sounds] -[laughter]]
Gary:  Do you think Fionna would take a fencing class with me? It would be so fun to spar. She'd be good at it. Hey, Fionna. We were just talking about you.
[sighs in relief]
[grunts]
Gary:  You know, you could invest in this place. Make something lasting? Be part of the community? [scoffs] You're off your nut, Campbell. Hmm? "Go beyond the end of the peach." Yah!
[coughing]
Gary:  Oh, my life.
[Cake laughing playfully]
Cake:  Come on, chicky, move those buns, baby!
Hunter:  I'm coming. I'm coming.
