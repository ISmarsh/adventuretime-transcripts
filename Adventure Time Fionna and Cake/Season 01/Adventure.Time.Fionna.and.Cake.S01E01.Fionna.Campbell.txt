Fionna:  Fionna and Cake to the rat-scue!

Fionna:  Help this man up!
Cake:  Help us, Fionna!

Cake:  Fionna, stab!

Cake:  Careful, careful!

Fionna:  Tit for tat, rat!

Fionna:  Hyah!

Fionna:  Ice Prince.

The ice won't hold him for long.

Cake:  You've got this, Fionna.

Fionna:  Hans Brinker action-go!

Cake:  Puck him up, girl!

Ice Prince:  Wa-woah!

Ice Prince:  Waugh-hmph.

Woman:  Good job, both of you!

Woman:  Fionna, Cake, you are great fighters.

Woman:  And so funny and interesting.

Woman:  Will you join me on my magical adventures?

Fionna:  Oh, ice Prince.

Cake:  Sure thing, bro.

Fionna:  Tell me.

Fionna:  Who are you, really?

Cake:  Huh?

Fionna:  Oh, gob no!

Cake:  Ughahh.

Snooze, 10 minutes.

"Cheers" is filmed before a live studio audience.

Evenin' everybody!

All:  Nooorm!

Norm:  Sammy! Set me up.

"Cheers" is filmed before a live...

"Cheers" is filmed before... "Cheers is... "Cheers" is...

"Cheers" is filmed before a live studio audience.

Fionna:  I don't wanna go to woooork.

Cake:  Wake up sleepy head, it's my turn to use the pants.

Cake:  Bad dream?

Fionna:  I had a great dream.

Cake:  It's the third night in a row

Fionna:  I've dreamed about a mysterious ice Prince.

Cake:  And you were there, too. And you could talk.

Cake:  And stretch!

Fionna:  I know, it sounds nuts!

Fionna:  But also..awesome.

Cake:  Buddy, your ears are freezing.

Cake:  Oh. Your nose, too!

Fionna:  Is that normal?

Fionna:  Maybe I have a fever?

Cake:  I'unno.

Cake:  Hm, I hope it's nothing serious.

Fionna:  That's the last thing we need right now.

Cake:  Wa wa wa wa Cake wa!

Cake:  Wa, wa, wa!

Cake:  Wa wa wa wa food!

Cake:  Wa wa wa wa wa wa wa.

Fionna:  Uhh...

Cake:  C'mon, weirdo.

Cake:  Weren't you hungry?

Cake:  You haven't really eaten in like... three days.

Cake:  How about tuna sandwich?

Cake:  It's your favorite.

Fionna:  My uniform!

Cake:  Stop acting crazy!

Fionna:  Ah!

Cake:  That's it, I'm calling the vet.

Fionna:  Okay, yeah.

Cake:  Yeah.

Fionna:  Okay, see you then.

Fionna:  Bye. Good news, Cake!

Cake:  We're going to the vet today

Cake:  But they only had a lunch time opening.

Cake:  So, guess you're coming to work with me, pal.

Cake:  Please try to act professional.

Cake:  Bleh.

Fionna:  Welcome to Queenie Bus Tours,

Fionna:  "Where bus dreams come true."

Fionna:  My name is Fionna Campbell, and I will be your guide today.

Fionna:  Do we have any folks visiting from out of town?

Ellis:  I'm from here.

I'm from around the corner!

Woman:  I'm also from here.

Ellis:  I live in the graveyard, uh, next to the graveyard.

Fionna:  Why do I even ask?

Fionna:  Over on our left we have out oldest building, the city post office.

Fionna:  In 1911 there was a fire, but they stamped...

Fionna:  Stamped it out!

Ellis:  Heh, yes.

Fionna:  Marshall Lee, everybody!

Fionna:  World's best unknown musician!

Fionna:  Catch him on the corner of 14th and Elm in half an hour.

Ellis:  Blah.

Ellis:  Oh! Uh... uh and... and, on our right, the city park.

Ellis:  Behold the largest outdoor fountain in a five block radius.

Woman:  Yay.

Ellis:  It underwent a renovation 12 years ago.

Woman:  Who's the statue of?

Fionna:  Dunno, dude.

Ellis:  We're now passing by the city aquarium.

Ellis:  Anybody not know what an aquarium is?

Woman:  Uh...
Great.

Ellis:  Now we got that covered.

Ellis:  You know what they say about the cafeteria.

Ellis:  Please do not "axolotl" questions when ordering the aquarium sushi.

Fionna:  Hey, anybody here into dream analysis?

Fionna:  Because I've been having this dream about a cool Ice Prince and giant penguins and stuff.

Fionna:  It feels like the universe is trying to tell me something.

Fionna:  Why would I dream about an ice guy?

Woman:  I had a dream once about some ice cream... It could mean, you know, like that one time...

Woman:  Uh, obviously you're dreaming about a cool Ice Prince now, because you just got dumped by a hot DJ Flame.

Woman:  That's it. I'm right.

Ellis:  Bro, you got dumped by DJ Flame?

Fionna:  W-Whatever that's not what it means, okay?

Fionna:  My dream is way more significant.

Ellis:  I dream a lot about being a hotdog.

I dream about being a banana!

Mine's too messed up to even talk about.

Fionna:  Hey, focus.

Ellis:  We all have weird food dreams, okay?

Fionna:  But my dream is special.

Fionna:  It means something.

Fionna:  I can feel it.

Ellis:  You're bombing, Fi!

Ellis:  See?

Ellis:  Cake agrees with me.

Fionna:  Woah, hey buddy.

Fionna:  Ah!
Fionna:  Ugh!

Cake. No, Cake.

Fionna:  Cake!

Merciful heavens!

Keep runnin', Cake!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

My allergies!

I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

That's enough!

Fionna:  Aha!

W-Wuh? Queenie?

W-Why are you here?

It's called a spot-check, ya ding dong.

I've gotten several complaints about your tours.

So I went undercover like a true boss.

And I see not only were the complaints true,

but you also bring a crazed animal on board?

I had to bring her.

She's sick or something.

Oh, a rabid crazed animal.

It's not her fault.

Cake's a good kitty!

Whuh. Uh, rabies!

Stop the bus!

Smooth driving, Van Damn.

Whatever, Marshall. You never pay anyway.

Hah, true, true. What?

It'll all come back around.

Don't worry.

He didn't pay?!

Uhh, what's the big deal?

These buses are always half empty.

It's not hurting anybody.

It's hurting my big fat wallet!

Psh. Whatever.

Cake:  Rrgh!

Turn in your uniform.

You're fired!

What?!

Mmm... Fine!

I never even wanted this stupid job in the first place.

And no one even cares about your dumb tours!

Jesus, stop!

Just bring it back later...

if you want your deposit back.

I do really need that deposit back.

Ugh, Cake, this is like my fifth job this year.

Maybe I could be like, a game designer?

I've got a lot of good ideas, right?

Ugh, it doesn't matter.

All the jobs suck in this stupid city. Hey, hey, check out my new mixtape.

And there's nowhere to go... Tea samples! Tea samples!

Nothing exciting ever happens.

And the people are all boring.

Ugh. Quit wiggling around, you nugget.

Okay, get this. You know Jerry from HR?

Oh yeah, Jerry.

Well, he told me he ate the contract papers

in front of the client! Excuse me.

I need to get through.

That's Jerry for ya. That's Jerry for ya.

Excuse me!

Move!

Whoa! Whoa!

Hey, that was an impressive display

of some real aggressive jerkiness.

Yeah. You should join our roller derby team.

We need bodies.

Both:  Ugh! She hurt our feelings real good.

Hmm, one latte coming up.

300 ml of milk.

And froth to 55 degrees.

High and slow.

Low and steady.

Beautiful.

Order for C.B!

Six butterscotch lattes

and three dozen cream puffs!

Ohh, thank you.

Gary, I know it was quiet a tall order

but my grandkids just love these little coffee drinks.

Just kidding! They're all for me!

One coffee to go...

Please.

Good morning.

And hello to you too, Cake.

Fionna:  Aw, what's wrong with her?

And what's wrong with you?

I'm fine.

Just got fired, my cat's acting weird

so I gotta take her to the vet now.

Which I can't afford because, oh yeah, I just got fired.

That's a bummer.

But maybe this will cheer you up.

My latest prototype.

Now, it's still in development, so give me your honest feedback.

Oh, oh! Just needs the final touch.

A raspberry buttercream scarf.

Mmm... good.

Fionna, it wasn't done.

Gary, how long have we known each other?

Hmm, I don't know.

I guess like, forever.

Then you should know by now I have zero impulse control

when it comes to sugary food.

I'm gonna make you more,

but this time, really savor and analyze it.

Dude, I said I liked it.

I know, but I need detailed feedback.

Cake:  Wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa.

Wa wa wa wa.

Cake:  Rrrr.

Wa wa, mouse!

Wot's this?

No roughhousing in my bakery!

There shouldn't be mice in the bakery either.

Phah, bakeries have mice in them.

It's always been this way.

Since ye olden days.

It's tradition.

Ugh, another one of your frilly abominations, eh?

Ahhh, wait, don't taste it yet!

The recipe's still in development!

Oh?

Huh!

Let's see how it compares to the classic choux pastry.

Agh, my heart.

Tsk, tsk, tsk.

Not even fit for a wee mousy.

Fionna:  Hey! What's your problem, BB?

Gary:  Gary worked hard on these biscuits.

Ellis:  Lass, this is Butler's Buttery Buns.

Woman:  And I say stick to what's traditional.

Gary:  Maybe raspberry was the wrong choice.

Ellis:  Gary, you should just quit!

Fionna:  Mmm...

Ellis:  I do it all the time.

Gary:  No, no, no, no, no, I just need to perfect the recipe first.

Fionna:  It's part of a 64-step plan to open my own bakery.

Fionna:  Gotta stick to the plan.

Ellis:  Pshh, plans.

Ellis:  I never make plans.

Fionna:  Right, Cake?

Gary:  Don't you have a vet appointment right now?

Fionna:  Ah!

Cake:  Shoot! Shoot!

Woman:  Here, take more biscuit people for the road.

Fionna:  Thanks Gary!

Cake:  Really chew on it!

Ellis:  I want notes!

Ellis:  ♪ Tumbleweeds and rattlesnakes ♪

Ellis:  ♪ Fighting off sidewinders ♪

Ellis:  ♪ Rode to town with my guns blazing ♪

Ellis:  ♪ Everyone knew I was amazing ♪

Fionna:  Wah, whoa!

Cake:  Woah, you okay?

Fionna:  Dammit, my uniform!

Cake:  Hey, so what.

Fionna:  That's your prison uniform.

Cake:  No way I get that deposit back now.

Cake:  Wait, did you quit your job?

Fionna:  That's a power move.

Cake:  Mh! Whoa. These are, like, really good.

Fionna:  Where are these from?

Fionna:  I didn't quit.

Cake:  I got fired.

Fionna:  Wah, wah.

Marshall:  Oh! Marshall, could you let your mom know

Fionna:  my rent is gonna be late this month?

Marshall:  Uhhh, me and her aren't really...

Fionna:  talking right now. What?!

Cake:  But I can barely afford the vet!

Marshall:  Nope! Not gonna do it.

Fionna:  Marshaaaall.

Cake:  But you know what though? Vets are like a total scam.

Marshall:  My buddy Ellis can fix her up and he'd only charge you like... a couple of theeese.

Fionna:  Sounds kinda shady.

Marshall:  Nooo. He's... he's... He's super legit.

Fionna:  Okay.

Fionna:  What's his address?

Cake:  Ow! Ugh.

Cake:  Rrrr...

Fionna:  Ugh!

Cake:  So nasty.

Fionna:  Sorry, Cake.

Fionna:  I wouldn't blunder through brambles for anyone but you.

Cake:  Argh!

Cake:  Ugh. If I die out here, no one's ever gonna find my corpse.

Fionna:  Aaaghh!

Sorry, traveler.

I mean no harm.

I'm just planting some weeds back here.

Don't you mean pulling weeds.

Ellis:  If you'll step into the bushes with me...

Ellis:  I'll show you something amazing.

Fionna:  Yeah, okay.

Ellis:  Keep going.

Fionna:  Wow.

Fionna:  You planted all this?

Ellis:  Yes.

Ellis:  Out there my job is to destroy all the wildflowers and weeds.

Ellis:  Did you know that any plant can be considered a weed?

Fionna:  What? That doesn't sound right.

Ellis:  Raspberries, roses, elms, all weeds in the wrong context.

Ellis:  In here these guys are chill and harmonious.

Ellis:  My beautiful misfits.

Ellis:  Behold.

Fionna:  A dandelion?

Ellis:  Taraxacum officinale.

Ellis:  Most people hate them, but they can grant wishes.

Ellis:  Just close your eyes and blow.

Hunter:  Yep. That's about sums it up.

Fionna:  Aw.

Hunter:  So, Ellis...

Fionna:  can you help my cat or what?

Hunter:  Uh, no, my name is Hunter.

Fionna:  Goddammit.

You looking for Ellis?

Ellis:  One for Bruno.

Ellis:  One for Brock.

Ellis:  One for Butch.

Ellis:  One for Stanly.

Ellis:  Wait, Stanly gets two.

Ellis:  Because he gets me.

Ellis:  I love you, bro.

Hunter:  That's Ellis P.

Hunter:  Another "beautiful misfit"?

Fionna:  Aren't we all?

Hunter:  You guys are so lucky to roll with me.

Ellis:  Excuse me. Ah! Stranger!

Hunter:  Get her, boys! Eat her face!

Ellis:  Et tu, Stanly?!

Fionna:  Um, Marshall said you could help my cat, Cake?

Ellis:  Oh, yeah. I'm deeply connected to all animals and speak their language.

Ellis:  But what's in it for me?

Ellis:  Omigosh, bagfood!

Ellis:  Payment accepted.

Ellis:  Step into my office and place cat on the exam table.

Woman:  You mean the little car?

Ellis:  Yes, I mean the little car!

Woman:  C'mon, Cake.

Woman:  It's okay.

Ellis:  'Aight, what's wrong with this little kitty cat?

Woman:  Cake's just been acting really weird lately.

Woman:  And I can't figure out why.

Fionna:  Hmm...

Ellis:  Oh, you're a sad one, aren't you?

Ellis:  Okay, try not to freak out when you see my powers in action.

Cake:  Wom wom wom wom wom wom wom wom wom.

Ellis:  Open up the channels of communication.

Woman:  What's that? Catnip?

Woman:  Yes, it's catnip!

Ellis:  So, what kinda symptoms are we talkin' about?

Woman:  Well, she's been really restless, and having bad dream...

Ellis:  I can sense that she's veeeerry restless

Woman:  and having bad dreeeeams.

Ellis:  I'm so intuitive.

Cake:  Wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa.

Fionna:  Cake says, hmm, that you know what's wrong.

Ellis:  She wants you to tell meee!

Woman:  I don't know what's wrong with her!

Ellis:  That's why I'm here!

Ellis:  Open your mind!

Woman:  Uh...

Fionna:  maybe she's sick?

Fionna:  Maybe she's not getting enough sleep?

Ellis:  Maybe she feels trapped in my crummy little apartment?

Fionna:  Well, yeah! Nobody feels good when they're trapped!

Ellis:  She's gotta get out, prowl the streets.

Fionna:  Where's she gonna go?

Ellis:  She's a cat in a sad little city!

Ellis:  Lotsa places, Midtown, Upper Midtown,

Ellis:  Central Midtown. Downtown?

Woman:  I'm not familiar. Ugh.

Fionna:  Maybe it doesn't matter where.

Woman:  What if she's just bored with everything and wishes the world was more magical?

Fionna:  It should be more magical.

Woman:  In my dreams I'm a beautiful prince.

Fionna:  Cake! Come back!

Cake:  You're welcome!

Fionna:  Cake!

Fionna:  Come back!

Fionna:  Sit!

Fionna:  I command you to sit!

Fionna:  Cake, please!
