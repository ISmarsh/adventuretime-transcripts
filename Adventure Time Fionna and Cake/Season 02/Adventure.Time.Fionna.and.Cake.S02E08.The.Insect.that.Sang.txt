Narrator:  Once upon a time, three fierce bandits prowled through the forest primeval.
[suspenseful music playing]
Narrator:  Fierce as they were...
[machine whirrs]
Narrator:  ...the bandits weren't very good. Until one day, their fortunes shifted. Destiny beckoned.
[enthralling music playing]
Narrator:  Fabulous powers were bestowed unto these most worthy rogues...
[music continues playing]
Narrator:  Powers that faded like morning dew without close company. They named this giver "The Heart of the Forest." The Green Wizards had everything they needed. But one day...
[mysterious music playing]
Narrator:  Fearing they would lose the heart again, the Green Wizards entrapped it. To keep their source of magic a secret... on pain of death.
[opening theme music playing]
[helicopter whirring]
[-What's going on? -What is that?]
Narrator:  Have you seen something like that before?
[cables snap]
Narrator:  What's going on? I'm pulling the venue. What?
Hana:  I was just using the fundraiser to get back into Marshall Lee's life. If he's out, I'm out. But, don't you want him to su-- If he somehow succeeds, Marshall will have gained some valuable business acumen. I'll find another venue. And the fundraiser's gonna be a big success. You're a fool, Campbell. The event is inconsequential. I need tonight's convergence to happen. [Hana laughs] Buh-bye.
Fionna:  Crap! I can find a new venue in less than a day. What, is event planning harder than saving the world once? First I got to call Phelix. Cake, can I use your phone?
[phone vibrates]
Fionna:  Oh, he's calling. Great timing.
[-Fionna... -[club music playing]]
Fionna:  ...I don't know if I'm gonna make it to the event tonight.
[-Please kill me. -[music playing over phone]]
Fionna:  Dude, I'm still at the Lemoncarb gig. They won't let me leave. [together] Hey! DJ Hotman! Yellowsweets wants dancier tunes.
[-Hold on. I'll be right there. -[music playing over phone]]
Fionna:  Thanks, Fionna.
[-Where'd that phone come from? -Give it!]
[-[DJ Flame] Please hurry. -[Lemoncarbs scream]]
Fionna:  First we just need to rescue DJ Flame. Then I'll find a new venue. I'm ready for whatever. That's what I'm talkin' about!
[inhales sharply]
Fionna:  Maybe this is a sign we should just throw in the towel. Cake, are you giving me guff? I'm just saying, we might want to start getting realistic here.
[-[warbles] -[Fionna gasps]]
Fionna:  We're going somewhere. Cake, I'm gonna be right back. Get the fundraiser going. Fionna! Ah, damn!
Simon:  Steady as she goes... Just relax and allow invisible forces to-- Log. [thuds] Ow! This is idiotic. We should section the forest into a grid and do a flachendeckende suche! You've got to trust in the universe. This is the only way to find out what's hurting him.
[device beeps steadily]
Simon:  It's okay, PB. We're doing... We're doing the right thing.
[grunts]
Simon:  What?
[-Where are we? -[shushes]]
[rumbling approaching]
Simon:  You Sheilas are in The Hall of Judgment. You've been accused of a serious cosmic crime.
[suspenseful music playing]
Simon:  [member] Murderer!
[overlapping angry dialogues]
Simon:  Uh, run!
[-[trilling] -[thuds]]
Cake:  Then Hana told Fi she was crazy even to try. And now Fi's disappeared. So what if Fi's plans are nuts? At least she's trying! You know her plan isn't even that nuts. I could probably pull it off.
[Cake reads]
Cake:  Honey, wherever Fionna is, I know she can take care of herself. We're making Boys Night happen! God, you're so hot. Cakey's gonna get you that money! We don't want any help from Hana. She's already out! Big blue ball and I don't even know what.
[-[overlapping angry dialogues] -[member] They deserve this!]
Orbo:  Court is now in session. In the course of his duties, Cosmic Owl was ruthlessly pursued and murdered by these two singulars. We got an anonymous tip from a hot witness. The punishment, an eternity in the pain vortex. Plead guilty now and I'll knock it down to an even thou.
[-[member] That sounds fair. -[indistinct murmur]]
[-We're here because of me. -Up-up-up!]
Orbo:  Not guilty! I've seen, like, five episodes of Night Court. I got this. I call the witness to the stand.
Scarab:  Oh! And in my own body as well.
[indistinct murmuring]
Scarab:  Recount for us, if you would, what you saw on the night in question. Well, as your honor knows, croak dreams are more Prismo's thing.
[-Yeah. -But I admit some curiosity.]
Scarab:  It's full of jalapenos, but it's not that hot. Seven to eight out of ten.
Scarab:  Come on, come on. Where is that dumb owl?
[car lock beeps]
[straining]
[Scarab gasps]
[-[shocked reaction] -[murmur]]
Scarab:  A cuckoo. Sick! Objection. Scarab's got a personal beef. Call Prismo, The Wishmaster. He'll vouch for me.
Orbo:  Hmm...
Fionna:  Call my fake dad! Prismo! Wha-- What's happening?
[belches]
Fionna:  I thought Jake was my number one. But you've always been there for me, Hoots. I'm sorry I took you for granted!
[cries]
Fionna:  Jesus, that's bleak. Uh... Eyewitness accounts are wrong, like 70% of the time.
Scarab:  Your Honor, I request my crystal for a demonstration. I'll allow it.
Scarab:  Cosmic blood on their hands.
[-[crowd gasps] -[member] That's evidence!]
Scarab:  Nasty work. We... We just wanted to talk Cosmic Owl out of Croaking Finn. It's better now that he's gone! The whole idea of fate is BS!
[-[member] Vile! -Order!]
Scarab:  One more outburst and you'll be gagged.
Scarab:  The prosecution rests, smugly.
[-[Fionna] Dick! -[Scarab gasps]]
[club music plays]
[music distorts]
Scarab:  Tempo! [groans]
[music starts fading out]
[bubbling]
[-[gas hisses] -Huh?]
[music perks up]
[club music continues playing]
Scarab:  Meow! What the hell! Ha-ha! Strangulate her!
Everplant:  Eat me, Pop Cop.
[-We've upped our security. -After the last break in.]
Everplant:  These supernatural freaks are invincible!
[Everplant and Pop Cop grunt]
[both pant]
[-[beaker thuds] -No!]
Everplant:  Get out. Get out. Get out!
Cake:  Hey! Nice setup. [both] What are you doing?
[vehicle approaches]
Cake:  Spread the word, Boys Night is back on! At the Lemoncarbs!
[disappointed chatter]
[-[man] Come on! -[man 1] Oh, man. Come on!]
Cake:  I quit my job to see DJ Flame. The party is still on! Follow us. Where's everyone going?
[fireworks bursting]
Cake:  Fionna, that son of a bitch!
[crowd murmuring]
[Huntress scribbling]
Huntress:  We're making a break for it. On three... Three!
[grunts]
Orbo:  What do you think? Skip straight to sentencing? Your Orbness, I would like to cross examine the witness. [sighs] You're up. Scarab, tell us exactly what you saw.
Scarab:  I saw you corpse disposing. So you're saying you didn't actually witness the moment of death? [Scarab hesitates] I... Well, maybe not. [member] Doesn't sound too sure.
[crowd murmuring]
Scarab:  Somebody killed Cosmic Owl, and you handled the body. Connect the flipping dots. Or, hypothetically, Cosmic Owl charged us. It would be self-defense. Taking initiative doesn't sound like the Cosmic Owl's--
Fionna:  Said he would get us all with croak dreams! With a gun!
[crowd murmuring]
[-[voices echoing] -[heartbeat thumping]]
[voices growing louder]
[voices fading out]
Fionna:  Finn did it.
[crowd gasps]
[gasps]
Fionna:  Feed that kitty, idiots. Thank you.
Marshall:  Hey... Got any double fudge delights? I'm sorry. I'll be moving along.
Marshall:  Simone, wait. I found out what my mom did. With Damon and everything. Yeah, well, I never wanted to get between a mother and her son. I got into music because of you. You were a really good influence on me. I was planning to do a new song tonight, but it's pointless now. Well, I'd still like to hear it. Someday. You're up, Squirrel. Do I want to help The Sweet Spot? Yes. Am I afraid of public speaking? No. Am I getting paid for this? Just get on the stage. Hey, gang.
[-Welcome to Boys Night. -[man] Whoo!]
Marshall:  We're raising funds for The Sweet Spot. Great place. Great place for a squirrel. Are you ready to see the main, if not sole reason you're here? DJ Flame!
[crowd cheering]
[-[cheering dies out] -Boy, that's your cue.]
Marshall:  Need a quick nap.
[snores]
Marshall:  Wake up, wake up! He's been DJing for two days straight. Use your head, dummy. I gotta buy some time. [kid] We got you, cat.
[crowd murmuring]
[-[man] That's not DJ Flame. -[woman] Where's DJ Flame?]

Destiny:  Sorry, Jay.
Fionna:  We helped move the body. But dream-Finn done the deed.
[-That's not true! -[Orbo] Ey!]
Fionna:  Cram it, Jawbreak--
Orbo:  Warned ya. Ow! What the hell, Huntr-- [chokes]
Scarab:  They're lying, Orbo. Just say the word.
[crowd murmuring]
Scarab:  Party God has cause for reasonable doubt! [howling]
[crowd arguing]
Scarab:  All right. All right! Next outburst is getting decked!
[-[captivating music playing] -[squirrels squeaking]]
Scarab:  Ta-da! And that's why I haven't brushed in years.
[-[crowd exclaims disgustedly] -[man] Gross!]
Woman:  We want Flame! [crowd chanting] We want Flame!
[-We want Flame! -[screams]]
Cake:  Sheeiit!
[-It's looking rough up there. -Mm.]
[phone vibrates]
Cake:  Please come sing. Boys Night needs you. Exclamation point, emoticon.
[sighs]
[groans]
[-Okay, I'm going up. -Yes!]
Cake:  [kisses] Knock 'em dead, babe. [man and woman] Where's Flame?
[Marshall strums guitar to music]
Man:  Who is this? Bring back Marshmallow Kid!

Marshall:  Yes!
[-Hey, great song. -Thanks, man.]
Marshall:  Seriously, it really lifted my spirit. Give it up for DJ Flame!
[crowd exclaims in excitement]
[-[starts playing music] -[crowd cheering]]
Marshall:  Gary, how's the count? It's not enough. Oh, come on! Hang on, Cake. [muffled grumbling] Ah! Dude! I know it's messed up, but I just got a weird feeling. Like a gut voice telling me it was the right thing to do. You-- [grunts in frustration] All right. This is turning into a real dog's dinner. You two can go for now. But don't leave town.
[-[warbling] -It worked!]
Marshall:  What about that weird fire guy? He could guest star as an arsonist. Brilliant.
[-[heavy noise] -[both scream]]
Marshall:  Backpay!
[continues playing music]
Cake:  Listen, people. If everyone donates just $2, it can make all the difference. Do it for Fionna. Please.
[straining]
Cake:  [grunts] Drop the money into a Cake basket.
[straining]
Cake:  Beep, beep, beep.
[sighs heavily]
Cake:  We're getting close.
[continues playing music]
[crowd cheering]
Cake:  [out of breath] Well, alone at last. [sniffs] Sorry. Aw!
[strained effort]
[exclaims nervously]
Cake:  Mmm... Mmm? Um, would you mind getting me a soda? I'm a little parched. What's not working? He's hot and I'm a... grown... lady. [gasps] Cake! [strained effort] Boys Night. I can still fix it.
[crowd cheering]
Cake:  We did it! The Sweet Spot is saved. We promise to make a space where everyone feels welcome. They Boys Nighted... without me?
[-Fionna! [laughs] -[gasps]]
[-You're amazing. -Yeah?]
Cake:  You know, I've been trying to keep it professional, but... Aw, you're shaking. Show me the heart.
Fionna:  Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
[Fennel gasps]
[-[sobs] -[both] Oh, no.]
[Fennel cries]
Fennel:  Fennel, wait. It didn't mean anything. Fennel! We were just vibing. Oh, Fennel.
[crowd cheering]
Huntress:  Oh, I missed something. This has all been useless. Sorry to disappoint you.
[winces and groans]
[sobbing]
Man:  Ring, ring. Ring, ring. Fionna! Ring, ring. Not that one.
Hana:  You proved me wrong, Campbell. I could use someone like you in my employ. I can offer you a free apartment, upward mobility, the company of beautiful men. What do you say? Fionna? Don't answer now. Just think about it.
[sobbing]
Hana:  Huh? My best friend, my hero, Fionna. I bust my butt for their dreams, to make them happy. And then they go and just do it without me? None of this would be here without me! Ugh! [panting] They don't need me? Guess they won't need this either. Or this! Stupid roses! [gasps] No. No, no, no, no, no. Please!
[crashes loudly]
Hana:  [Fionna coughs] Ugh! What have I done? [sniffs] Hmm.
[gentle music plays]
[gasps]
[sniffling]
Hana:  Did I secretly want them to fail? I'm horrible. This is the heart. All these roses. The reason I couldn't pinpoint it earlier is because your world's heart is everywhere.
[slash]
[inhales and exhales sharply]
Hana:  I can't make a connection. I've got the heart, the ritual, the broken tool. Just do whatever it takes. What if we cut off your hand? Can we try something else first? Close your eyes and look inside yourself. No!
Simon:  Ow! Wait. I know this.
[screams]
Simon:  We're close.
[wheezing breath]
Simon:  It looks bigger. But this is what hurt Finn. It's been totally jerky-fied. Can you save it? All I can do is help it die with dignity. With my ball-bam-burglerber.
[moans]
Simon:  I'm sorry.
[loud blast]
[cries]
[necklace beeping]
[-Beemo. -Finn is doing great.]
Simon:  He has ascended from this plane. What?
[mysterious music plays]
[spooky music playing]
