Narrator:  <i>A long time ago...</i> <i>before the dawn of most things,</i> <i>there were two brothers,</i> <i>and they were inseparable.</i> <i>They were a mischievous pair,</i>
[both laugh]
Narrator:  <i>And one day,</i> <i>their pranks went too far.</i>
[both laugh]
Narrator:  <i>They were so proud</i> <i>of eating the etheric pizza,</i> <i>which they had been</i> <i>told never to touch.</i> <i>But dang how good it was...</i> <i>Until...</i> <i>When they found themselves</i> <i>in serious hot water,</i> <i>these tight knit brothers</i> <i>began quarreling</i> <i>for the very first time</i> <i>One brother panicked and laid</i> <i>the blame on the other.</i> <i>- Judgment was swift.</i> - [blade whirring] <i>The brothers were separated.</i> <i>The one accused</i> <i>of being the instigator</i> <i>was cast down,</i> <i>never to be heard from again.</i> <i>The other was chastised</i> <i>for betraying his brother</i> <i>and was sentenced</i> <i>to become fate's messenger.</i>

[opening theme playing]
Gary:  What's up, Fionna? Is everything okay? You sounded so serious on the phone. Dead serious.
[- Ahh! - [crow caws]]
Gary:  Nice ambience. No Hunter... I've got good news, everybody. Follow me. You comin', HW? No. Gotta find the heart. Who's your surly friend? Oh, she's an alternate version of Hunter marooned in our universe. Oh.
[crows caw]
Gary:  Wait, what are we doing here? Surprise! It's our venue. Welcome. Uh... Why? Why? Can't a mother help her son? We had to move fast, so I made the deal last night.
[coughs]
Gary:  It's great, right? We can fit so many people in here. But why would you want to? Oh, Marshall, you belong here. How do you like yourself in Carrara marble, darling? I made them redo your face five times. I think you look like an angel. Is that one yours? Not at all. It's for you. Or whoever Marshall ends up with. We'll see how this works out. Gee, thanks. No, no. Decorate with a sense of grandeur.
Cake:  Hmm. I was thinking you guys could maybe, like, skate around town and hand them out. Hey, don't go down that path with that lady.
[- I know where it leads. - [laughing]]
[- What? No, you don't. - Uh-huh!]
Cake:  I saw a vision of the future where you end up as her lackey. Pfft, no way that'll happen. She's not using me. I'm using her. Okay, people, we've only got three days till the event. Go spread the word. You heard her, flunkies. Faster! Pronto, pronto! Man, I don't know about this. She knows you'd never take her money directly. But isn't this kind of perfect? Where else can you be sure your mom is going to hear what you're saying? And isn't it kind of punk or metal to play a set on top of your own grave? Punk, huh? [chuckles] Dork. Fionna, I wanted to say... [sighs] "Hey, Fionna, I'm sorry I hung up on you. I was feeling..." Hmm. [in Spanish] <i>Que planta tan hermosa.</i> [in English] Hey! Don't touch me. You're me?
[- [grunts] - [Huntress] No.]
Cake:  You are a soft version of me. Weak. You don't know me. Let's keep it that way. Real tough guy, huh?
[grunts]
[machine beeping]
Bubblegum:  I hate seeing him this way.
[groaning weakly]
Bubblegum:  I didn't want to bring this up, but I know a way to save him. Huh? No vampire stuff. I have a better idea. Hey! Old Lady Princess! Oh, oh, oh, I'm here. Are we doing more kissing? [smacks lips] No, I need a volunteer lab rat. I'll do anything to save-- Ah! Oh! I'm hideous. Ahh! You're just gonna plump him up? It's good for morale if Finn looks healthy... and smooth.
Vampire King:  Marceline, Marceline.
Simon:  But that's just cosmetic. You're only treating the symptoms.
[groans]
Simon:  We need to keep people's spirits up. Or there could be panic across multiple kingdoms.
Vampire King:  Why hesitate, child? Bestow upon him The Dark Gift.
[- Do it, do it. Now! - [pulse beating]]
Vampire King:  Okay.
[- [gasps] - [slurping]]
[gasps]
[moans, thud]
Vampire King:  [Bubblegum and Simon] Marceline!
Cake:  Nigh, nigh, Fi.
DJ Slime:  <i>You're listening</i> <i>to the original D.R.O.F,</i> <i>my name is DJ Slime.</i> <i>It's five past the hour.</i> <i>Get ready for an all-night jam</i> <i>with DJ Flame.</i>
DJ Flame:  <i>Shout out</i> <i>to all my babies out there.</i> <i>Looking forward to being</i> <i>with you through the night.</i> <i>Flame's got you.</i>
[snoring]
DJ Slime:  <i>You're so cool.</i> <i>I'm glad you owe me</i> <i>a life debt.</i>
[door opens]
DJ Slime:  Wrong!
[grunts]
DJ Slime:  Baby Finn?
[chewing]
DJ Slime:  What are you talking about, Dr. Calvin? Hell yeah, I want the epidural. Finn.
[- [mechanical whirring] - Finn!]
DJ Slime:  Why did you have to be such a stupid blundering meat sack? Why did you have to get hurt? I tried to save you. And look where it landed me.
[leaves fluttering]
DJ Slime:  Finn! It's not real.
Cosmic Owl:  That's so weird. You're dreaming about my next stop. I gotta give Finn a croak dream. Croak dream? No! Ahh! Whoa! I'm just doing my job. Cosmic Owl!
[piano playing]
Cosmic Owl:  Huh?
[breathing heavily]
Cosmic Owl:  You're a true loser.
Fionna:  Help me. Hello? I'm stuck, Bunhead. I'll-- I'll get you out.
[grunts]
[groaning]
Fionna:  Get off my tail, girl! No croak dream! What's going on?
[- You're dreaming, genius. - [owl hooting]]
Fionna:  Dreaming? Oh, oh, oh. Huntress! Do you need help?
[grunts]
[machine beeping]
Fionna:  I'm scared. What if they turn out all mixed up like me?
[audience laughing]
Fionna:  A little known fact, Sammy, your ancient Egyptians there worship the feline animal. Ahh! My babies.
[yells]
Fionna:  Ow! Ow! Ow! Fionna, don't you step on my babies. We gotta follow that bird, Cake.
[grunts]
Fionna:  MC, I'll be back. It's okay, M-Cron. She's gone now. Let me take you out for coffee. Get your mind off things.
[laughter]
Fionna:  [alien robot] Coo, coochy, coochy. Simone? Simone? Simone!
[panting]
Fionna:  What? No, no. Tie your shoes, mister. I'm sorry, Mom. Mmm. Why do you have to make it so hard? I'm sorry.
Fionna:  You don't have to take that from her. Talk back! Oh, man. Oh, man.
[gasp]
Fionna:  Look at what's happening. Ooh! Ahh! I knew it. We must be in Flame's dream.
[grunting]
Fionna:  No! We're meant to be. Mmm-- Ooh! Mmm-- Ooh!
[- [yells] - [toys squeak]]
Fionna:  Uh, this is normal, by the way. Sleeping with toys is normal. Yeow! Just like my dream.
DJ Flame:  <i>Up next, we got</i> <i>something off my first EP,</i> <i>- "Firefly."</i> - [turns off radio] Yeah, the Cosmic Owl's presence makes dreams come true. And he's on his way to give Finn a Death Dream.
[- Ah! - Uh...]
DJ Flame:  I was trying to stop him, but I lost his trail, thanks to you. Why not just go into Finn's dream and stop him there? I would need to find an open conduit to him. You're a Finn. Sort of.
[sniffs]
DJ Flame:  And you've been to Ooo. Have you met Finn? I've met a Finn. You're thrice blessed. Think of him. Oh, hello! [groaning] Where are we? We're in Finn's mind. Our meat bodies are still back in the cat's apartment. Fionna! Huntress! Are you guys doing okay? Bleh! Those fingers are in that brain. Finn should be here somewhere. Ahh!
[bubbling]
DJ Flame:  You. Oh, hey. How's your head? My head is fine. My heart is heavy. Jay ran away with Little Destiny. It's okay. They're both very happy and safe in my world. Your world?
[Finn grunts]
Fionna:  Finn? Enough of this. He isn't the right Finn. You have to think of the right, Finn. I've met another Finn. Saved my life once. That sounds like him. Think of him.
[slurping]
Fionna:  There you go, Marcie. Get all those color nutrients. You're doing good, babe.
[machine beeping]
Fionna:  Where's Finn?
[- Here. - Not you.]
Fionna:  My bad. Found him! Are we early or too late?
[screaming]
[smooch]
[all scream]
Fionna:  Cries of distress. Yes!
[all yelling]
Fionna:  Adventure time! Fionna, Keep dream Finn safe. We'll keep watch for Cosmic Owl. Oh! Hello, handsome!
[grunting]
Fionna:  Dang.
[groaning]
[grunting in effort]
Fionna:  Bro can take care of himself. What? Ahh! Hey! You ungrateful little ticks! Oh, no.
[clapping]
[- Finn? - [clock chimes]]
Fionna:  Archers! Ready? Loose arrows. Yeah, yeah! But... He died. As long as Cosmic Owl isn't here, it don't count. Come on. Look for anything that makes noise and rope.
[rattles]
Fionna:  Reload!
[speaking backwards]
Fionna:  Haha! I got you!
[- Come on, dude. - [archer] Loose arrows!]
Fionna:  Get down! Good hit. Finn, you're in a coma and we're in a dream. Oh, cool. Who are you? My name is Fionna, and I'm here to keep you alive. Dude, you're like my girl-Jake. Ahh! [groaning] Get up.
[gasps]
Fionna:  Finn! Finn!
[audience clapping]
Fionna:  Hurry.
[both panting]
Fionna:  Who are you? You're in a coma dream, but I'll keep you safe. Math! You're like a girl-Jake. Ahh!
[- Who are you? - It doesn't matter.]
[both grunting]
Fionna:  Finn! Fionna!
[maniacal laughter]
Fionna:  Un-sand him! Who are you? Time's up. Ahh!
[- Who are you? - [clock chimes]]
[audience clapping]
[grunting]
Fionna:  Argh!
[- Oh, hey. Who are-- Ahh! - Ahh!]
Fionna:  Dang, we got a real laser master over here.
[- I did it! - Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!]
Fionna:  Ahh! No!
[audience clapping]
[panting]
[clock chimes]
[grunts]
Fionna:  Yeah, buddy. Feels good! How do you keep going? That's what heroes do. But how do you know if what you're doing is right? I listen to my hero heart and trust the universe to lead me. Hero heart! Slash! Ahh!
[bells ringing]
Fionna:  Ahh! I hate this.
[both grunting]
Fionna:  This is it. The Cosmic Owl is here. Begone, vulture. Listen, I don't have a choice. I'm just the messenger. Then I'll have to croak the messenger.
[- [grunts] - [straining]]
[screaming]
[grunts]
[grunts]
Fionna:  Ahh! It's all good. I stopped the Cosmic Owl in time. "In time"?
[laughs]
Fionna:  Heckin' heck. So you, like killed a God? Is that gonna be a big deal?
[grunts]
Fionna:  So what's your story? You're like a hot me. I owed you one.
[clock cuckoos]
Fionna:  I should add an axe mod.
Huntress:  Finn. Huntress. I know your only dream-Finn. And you're not gonna remember this, but I'm gonna save you. I love you, Huntress. Later, Mertens. Who are you? Argh! Huntress? You should let him know what he means to you.
[- I'm gonna remove my hands now. - What?]
Huntress:  Ahh!
[yawns]
Huntress:  Did it work? Yes. Finn will live... For now.
[snoring]
Huntress:  is she narcoleptic? I just watched a guy get killed, like, a thousand times.
[licks]
Huntress:  Uh, Fi, maybe you should take a day off. I can't. I need to save The Sweet Spot and help my friends. I'm supposed to be a hero.
Cake:  You already are a hero.
[sighs]
Cake:  It's just hard. Girl, just get out there and follow your heart. My heart.
[upbeat music playing]
Cake:  DJ Slime, all night. The city sleeps while we provide the beats here at GROF 95.5. We got those out of this universe--
[knocking]
Cake:  Looks like we have a stalker dropping by the studio. If we're not back after this deep cut, come check on us, Mom.
[Wilhelm scream plays]
Wilhelm:  And if we do need a tasteful funeral bouquet, turn to today's sponsor. Hey, what's up? This is gonna sound weird, but I saw you in a dream. It felt important. Yeah? What kind of dream? Uh... This is kind of a big thing. [stuttering] I wanted to know if you-- I know what you're gonna ask. I've been thinking about it, too. Oh? Yes, I'll play at your fundraiser. Anything to help you, Fi. Oh. Okay. Yeah!, Really?
[- That's great. - Hey, keep it down!]
Wilhelm:  I'm trying to listen to DJ Flame.
[- Look out! - Ahh!]
Wilhelm:  Fionna. [distorted] Fionna.
[gasp]
[phone ringing]
Wilhelm:  Uh... Thanks. Hey. No, no, Fen. He was kidding about a stalker. It was nothing to worry about.
[groans]
[guitar playing]
Wilhelm:  <i>♪ You wanted me</i> <i>To buy my shoes </i>♪ ♪ <i>To tie my shoes </i>♪ He's risen.
