[The episode begins with Simon continuing to read the choose-your-own-adventure book in the far-future library.]
[Moon demons laughing]
Simon:  [chuckles] Unholy things, give us that crown. B-bwow!
[Moon demons growling]
Simon:  Shwa-zaah!
Casper:  Nova, that was amazing.
Nova:  I just cast the spell you showed me.
Moon Demon King:  [laughs] Moon Demon King. Too late, Casper. [laughs] I'm going to an undisclosed third location.
[Ting]
Casper:  Thwarted again.
Nova:  I could summon a sun-ship to give chase.
Casper:  I think we should check the launch pad for clues about where he's headed.
Nova:  Yeah, that sounds smart, too. What do you think we should do?
Simon:  "Fire once for Casper's idea. Fire twice for Nova's."
Beth:  Every time we get close, the crown gets further away. This book cheats.
Beth:  Simon, I know you're really into this story but if you're not enjoying yourself, you can just stop. That's the great thing about books.
Simon:  No.

[They are interrupted by Pawn Swan.]
Pawn Swan:  Yoo-hoo! Bloo-bloo-bloo. Gimme that thingus, dingus.
Beth:  You? Get outta here, Choose Goose.
Pawn Swan:  Silly boy. [chuckles] The geese are long gone. Now is the era of... [singsong voice] Pawn Swan.
Beth:  Get outta here!
Pawn Swan:  Goldang geese! What's got into you?
Beth:  We love Pawn Swan.
Simon:  [sighs] Look, I know this is hard to understand but I have to decode the secrets of this book. I have to. I have to. I have to... I have to stop the Scarab.

[Back in Fionna's world, the Scarab reforms and attacks.]
Scarab:  Crossovers.
Fionna:  Crud.
Cake:  Oh, no, he's hot.
Fionna:  He ruined our house.
Cake:  Aah!
Fionna:  Hey, man. I'm sorry we put you in a bunch of jars but we're back in our world now so it's all good, right?
Scarab:  [chuckles] All the worlds you've visited all the people you've infected. Your little trip must have shown you the truth. It would be better for everyone if you were just gone.
Fionna:  [growls]
Cake:  'Scuse.
Fionna:  Get zapped.
Scarab:  My crystal.
Cake:  Get eggy.
Scarab:  Hand it over.
Za'Baby:  [grunts]
Za'Baby:  Za'Baby.
Za'Baby:  Scarab? All I was doing was playing games on my work PC and you put me in a flippin' egg?
Za'Baby:  Keep laying. Cluck, cluck!
Scarab:  Get out of my way.
Za'Baby:  Oh-ho-ho! Well, if it isn't Mr. Entomb His Coworker Because She Was Stealing Office Supplies.
Za'Baby:  Scarab, you dweeb. This is for the egg.
Scarab:  Enough, you cosmic delinquents.

[A giant living island appears.]
Perry:  Hello. I'm Perry, the living island of insight may you direct me to the nearest ocean? Or inland sea?
[Rumbling, grunts]
Cake:  Terry.
[Grunts]
[All scream]

[Simon continues reading in the library.]
Simon:  [grunts]
[Chuckles]
Simon:  We're in luck. These rockets have a pre-programmed route to the cosmic gate.
Nova:  Oh, no, but the Moon Demon King is so far ahead we'll never catch up.
Casper:  Up-up-up. Now that we have the destination I've figured out a shortcut.
Nova:  Oh, Casper, I should have known.

[The battle in Fionna's world intensifies.]
[All panting]
[Grunts]
Cake:  Get up, Fi.
Fionna:  Crystal.
Hunter:  Oye.
[All grunting]
[Groans]
Fionna:  Ants.
[Gary and Hunter grunt]
Fionna:  Hey.
[Grunts]
[Marshall and Gary groan]
Scarab:  Slick.
[Gasps]
Scarab:  If I can't extract this place whole... I'll rip it out piece by piece.
Fionna:  Tree.
[People screaming]
Cake:  Our post office. That was our oldest building.
Fionna:  Back up, everybody. I've seen movies.
[Grunts]
Cake:  Ooh, I think I stretched too big.
Fionna:  Go, Cake!
Cake:  Love you, Fi.
[Grunts]
Cake:  Ya!
Fionna:  Blegh.
Fionna:  Hey, Cake, little help?
Cake:  Time to get hammered!
Scarab:  Oh, yeah.
[Panting, grunts]

[Simon reaches a pivotal moment in the book.]
Beth:  "The Cosmic Gate." Well, this is it.
[Trigger clicks]
Beth:  "Casper and Nova arrive at the cosmic gate. On the other side lies the magic crown."
Simon:  Yes.
Beth:  But the gate's closing.
Casper:  Nova.
Nova:  [panting] Wait.
Nova:  [groans] We can't both make it. But you can climb through, Casper. Go.
Casper:  Aw, geez.
Simon:  "Casper reaches into his cloak." What do we do? "Fire once, Nova will hold the gate open long enough for Casper to grab the crown but she'll be crushed. Or Casper drinks a potion that'll give him the strength to force the gate but it will also cause him to forget Nova forever."
Beth:  Forever?
Simon:  Yeah, these options are real downers. But, hey, the crown's right there.
Simon:  Beth, I don't want either of those things to happen. I like Nova.
Simon:  There should be more choices.
Beth:  Well, maybe there would be if you hadn't picked Casper's options every time.
Simon:  What? I did? That's... That doesn't sound right. There was the time I...
Beth:  If we had gone on Nova's tablet quest or ordered the baos that Nova wanted from the food wizard it could have led down a completely different path.
Simon:  But they were both after the same thing, the crown. Weren't they?
Beth:  I guess you're a kid. You don't get this stuff yet. Nova was basically obsessed with Casper.
Simon:  Wait. I thought... I thought they were in love.
Beth:  They were, but it wasn't exactly on equal footing. I guess that's not Casper's fault per se.
Simon:  But he could have been more thoughtful. He could've noticed that she was sacrificing over and over. He could've...
Simon:  Nyah! Get it off me!

[Simon realizes the truth about his relationship with Betty.]
Simon:  Hey, Beth, I was a prisoner in my own head.
[Chuckles, growls]
Cake:  Roar!
[Grunting]
[Grunts]
Fionna:  Oh, my God. Cake's so cool.
Prismo:  Yeah, but I'm worried she's overextending herself.
[Swallows]
Cake:  Yay.
[Shouts, groans]
Cake:  My breadbasket.
Fionna:  Oh, no, Cake. Cake...
Cake:  Sorry, Fionna. You did great.
Scarab:  You're in eight, right?
Fionna:  [gasps]
[Screams]
Fionna:  Oh, no, Ellis P. was in there.
Prismo:  What?
Fionna:  [groans] I'm not magic. I don't have a sword. I can't do anything.
[People screaming]
Scarab:  [scoffs]
[Grunts, snarls]
Marshall Lee:  You more of a butter-tart guy?
Gary:  I'll stop him... with music.
Marshall Lee:  Your song about tumbleweeds?
Gary:  No, a new, heartfelt song inspired by our love.
Fionna:  I think it's work--
[Both grunt]
Scarab:  [laughs]
Fionna:  No.
[Gasps]
[Marshall and Gary coughing and groaning]
[Cake groans]
Fionna:  Please. I take it back. I want this world!

[Simon has a vision of Betty and realizes the truth about their relationship.]
Simon:  Oh, Betty. Is that what it was like? I stood by and allowed you to sacrifice yourself for me. Even though part of me should've known better. Like that day at the bus stop.
Past Simon:  Betty!
Past Betty:  Betty... Petrikov.
Past Simon:  I could've made the effort to support you the way you always supported me. Maybe I never would have found the crown.
Past Simon:  I, uh-- I-I found your note.
Past Betty:  Yeah?
Simon:  Who knows what life would have been like.
Past Simon:  You should be more careful with...
Simon:  You know what? The Enchiridion can wait. Let's go check out some petroglyphs.
Past Betty:  Really? You'd do that for me?
Past Simon:  Oh, Petrikov.
[Chuckles]
[Air brakes hiss]
Simon:  But wait. This isn't how it happened.
Past Betty:  No, we made our choices. We could've made better ones but I don't have any regrets.
Past Simon:  You were a wonderful experience.
Past Betty:  You were... everything.
[Bus door closes]
Simon:  Where are you going?
Simon:  Was that conversation all in my head? I think... I only offered to become Ice King because I felt my life didn't matter. But I'm really no less worthy of life than Fionna or Cake.

[Simon receives a call from Fionna.]
[Cellphone vibrating]
[Line ringing]
Fionna:  Simon.
Simon:  Fionna. What happened? Are you okay?
Simon:  I'm okay. I accidentally got the ritual to work. I'm with GOLBetty.
Fionna:  Hey, that's great. Did you talk?
Simon:  Mostly I talked. Listen, the Scarab is here.
Fionna:  Oh, no. Hang on. I'll put on the crown. Maybe you can fight better with magic.
Fionna:  Don't. Don't change anything. This is the world we want to fight for. The Scarab is kinda invincible...
Cake:  Fionna, let's go.
Fionna:  ...but we won't give up.
Simon:  But, Fionna, what if--
Fionna:  If we die, we'll die together. As ourselves.
Simon:  It's not fair that your world is in my stupid head.
Fionna:  Hey, if it wasn't we wouldn't have met the Simon Petrikov. Don't worry, Simon.
Queenie:  What happened to my bus?
Simon:  I gotta go.
Simon:  Fionna--
[Cellphone beeps]
Queenie:  I swear it was right here.
[Grunting]
Simon:  I didn't ask for this responsibility. It's too much.
[Grunts]
Simon:  GOLBetty.
[Coughing]
Simon:  It's too much...
GOLBetty:  Fionna-world?
Simon:  Fionna's world.

[GOLBetty releases Fionna's world as an independent universe.]
[Indistinct conversations]
Fionna:  Come on, Cake. Please get up.
Cake:  Just give me five minutes.
Fionna:  I'm not sure we have five minutes.
[Cellphone vibrating]
Fionna:  Simon, please don't make it harder.
Simon:  I have something for you. Fionna. What are you talking about?
[Grunting]
Fionna:  Is that...
Simon:  Yes. Your world.
Fionna:  What do I do with--
Simon:  You'll do fine.
[Line clicks]
Cake:  That's our world?
Prismo:  So now what? Do we eat it?
Fionna:  Our universe was inside one dude for years and years. But it wouldn't be right for us to have it, either.
Cake:  Of course not.

[Fionna makes a wish and releases her world to the universe.]
Fionna:  I wish...
[Chuckles]
Woman:  Que linda.
Fionna:  I don't totally understand what's happening.
Cake:  Come to mama.
[People murmuring]
[Rumbling]
Fionna:  Thank you.
[Blows]

[The Scarab tries to capture the universe but fails.]
Scarab:  Oh, no.
Prismo:  One of these has to lead to Ooo.
[Grunts]
Scarab:  Gonna have to ice these knucks for a week. Okay, let's see. Is Fionna-world still there?
Prismo:  Wait, what? They're legit now? How did that happen?
Scarab:  It's gonna hurt.
Prismo:  Oh, glob.
[Groans]
[Gasps]
Scarab:  Ha! You can't repo an authorized universe.
Scarab:  No...
Prismo:  Come on.
[Groans]
[Indistinct talking]
Scarab:  This isn't possible. Unless, this universe has been canonized.
[Telephone ringing]
Scarab:  Boss? Okay, but-- ugh, it's not fair. I did everything right.
Prismo:  Yay! We won! Come on, bring it in.
Scarab:  No, listen... I-- Boss, please. [sighs] Fine.
Fionna:  Hey, Mr. Scarab? No hard feelings, okay?
Scarab:  [chuckles] No hard feelings? [grunts] I'm gonna tear down Prismo's precious sandcastle with my bare hands!
[Screams]
Fionna:  Oh, crap.
Prismo:  That guy's just not cool.
Cake:  There's gotta be something I can do.
[Gasps]

[Fionna confronts the Scarab with help from friends across the multiverse.]
Fionna:  Hey, Scrabby, stop wrecking my town just 'cause you got beef with Prismo. If anything, you should be mad at us.
[Snarls]
[Fionna and Cake scream]
Finn:  Ma'am.
Jay:  [giggles]
Little Destiny:  Alright, baby.
Jay:  Yay, baby!
Finn:  Hey. Some pink laser came to visit us all. Said you needed back-up.
Fionna:  Aw, thanks, y'all.
Little Destiny:  Hey, friend. Sorry I bailed on you before. Never again.
[Crash]
Peanut:  Don't hurt me!
Scarab:  [grunts]
Little Destiny:  Squirrel, throw the strawbs.
Squirrel:  Oh. Right.
Little Destiny:  Eat 'em. I meant like one or two.
Scarab:  Oh, my God!
Jay:  Cake!
Cake:  What? This is my top fantasy.
Fionna:  Lemme try this again.
[Grunts]
Fionna:  Ya! Blegh.
Fionna:  Hey, Cake, little help?
Cake:  Time to get hammered!
Scarab:  Oh, yeah.
[Panting, grunts]

[The Scarab is defeated and imprisoned.]
Scarab:  You think you've won something? You were living in this fake bubble where nothing happens. But now you get all the bad stuff, too. Your world to screw up.
Fionna:  That just sounds like we're real to me.
Scarab:  Nyeh, nyeh.
Cake:  Egg you.
[Both grunt]
Fionna:  Jay. Heads up!
Jay:  Guess what. I'm a copycat.
[Grunts]
[Egg beeping]
Fionna:  It's over. What do we do now?
[Stomach rumbles]
Finn:  Oh, I got you something to eat. No more mice.
[Indistinct shouting]
Little Destiny:  Eyyy.
Jay:  Fionna.
Jay:  Would it be okay if we just stayed here?
Fionna:  Oh, angels, stay forever.
Jay:  Yes. Thank you.
Little Destiny:  You have functioning toilets.
Fionna:  Yeah. Yeah, we do.

[The Scarab is sentenced to work in the Time Room.]
Prismo:  All in all, I think Orbo let you off easy. It probably helped that I put in a good word for you.
[Scarab grumbles]
Prismo:  Maybe you can even grant a wish in a couple hundred years. But you gotta pay your dues first.
Scarab:  Only people who never pay their dues say that.
Prismo:  Hey, Scarab, why don't you take five? I'll show you how to use my character-creation program. So I like to start with an overall theme. How about true heroes?
Scarab:  No. Put in "dark medieval mystery drama."
Prismo:  Wow, okay.

[Simon reflects on his journey.]
Simon:  I'm feeling like this whole experience with Fionna and Cake helped me realize that my life is worthwhile. I'm worried I'll forget that. This will be a cycle of learning and forgetting and relearning and forgetting again.
Dog Tourist:  This is juicy stuff. Keep going.
Simon:  I'm thinking of moving.
Simon:  Just a normal world.
