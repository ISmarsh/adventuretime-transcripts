Fionna:  Huntress?
[squeaks]
[grunts frustratedly]
[-[squeaks] -[grunts]]
[-[squeaking continues] -[frustrated grunting]]
[-Hey. -[gasps]]
Fionna:  What are we looking for?
Huntress Wizard:  Something that connects you to the green magic of your world.
Huntress Wizard:  Like I've got this dark corner in the back of my mind where magic flows.
Huntress Wizard:  You must have something similar.
Huntress Wizard:  Though it could be symbolized by anything.
[grunts]
Fionna:  Wha...
Fionna:  Is my mind inside Huntress's mind in my mind?
[female voice crying]
[flames whoosh]
[crying continues]
[-Open! Open! -[banging at door]]
Huntress Wizard:  I'm never gonna get back home.
Huntress Wizard:  I won't be able to save Finn.
[cries]
Fionna:  I'm sorry.
Fionna:  Everything sucks.
Huntress Wizard:  The Heart.
Huntress Wizard:  I thought the way to The Heart would be within you.
Huntress Wizard:  But it was in my inner Mope.
Fionna:  I'm sorry.
[slurps]
Huntress Wizard:  This is my exit.
Huntress Wizard:  Uh, goodbye, Fionna.
Fionna:  Screw it.
Fionna:  Whoa!
[yowls]
[opening theme music playing]
Fionna:  Nice.
Fionna:  Whoa! [struggling]
Fionna:  Orbs.
Mope:  Cool. A new world to ruin.
[screams]
Fionna:  Hey! Why did you follow me?
Mope:  Why do I do anything?
[straining]
Fionna:  Dude, are you getting heavier?
Mope:  That's what I do.
Mope:  Pull everyone down.
Fionna:  No! [straining]
Fionna:  Flip!
[spits]
Fionna:  What now?
Huntress:  No! Flip! My girls!
[straining]
Huntress:  I'm coming, Fionna!
[distant screeching]
[-[screeching continues] -Uh?]
Huntress:  I hear you. Bushbaby!
Huntress:  Cake! Where's Fionna? She fell down another level. Catch!
[-[sharp snap] -[grunts]]
[screeching]
Huntress:  I'm coming. For Fionna! I gotta be brave?
[-[bellowing] -[screams]]
Huntress:  You're not a painball.
[-[strains] -[soft thud]]
Huntress:  Where's the ground? [screams]
[soft thud]
Huntress:  Huh?
[gasps]
[exclaims]
[Fionna screaming]
Fionna:  Of course I land in an alien death trap! I guess this is what I deserve.
[blade whooshes]
[grunts]
[coughing]
[gasps]
Fionna:  Who are you?
[screeching continues]
Fionna:  You're close.
[-[whimpering] -Hey, little guy.]
Fionna:  I'm not gonna hurt you.
[whimpering]
Fionna:  Poor sap.
[whimpers]
[trilling]
Fionna:  Oh, your name is Russel. What happened to you? Your home has been poisoned too.
[whimpers]
[warbling, trilling]
[exclaims]
[gasps, exclaims]
Fionna:  Let's take you home.
[groans disgustedly]
Fionna:  What is this?
Karmic Worm:  Those are my castings.
[hisses]
Karmic Worm:  Sorry for slamming into you back there. I wasn't expecting company. I don't see a lot of new faces. Just new painballs. Welcome to The Undergrowth. I'm the Karmic Worm. Could you pass me that? Eating those is kind of my job.
[clanks]
Karmic Worm:  You live down here... eating pain? When someone in the multiverse pushes down a thought, I process it so it can fruit again on these trees. A new framework, a little lighter. When they're ripe, they'll float on back to their source. They might cycle back down here again, not that I look. Huh? How did you get here? [chuckles] Not that I'm complaining. It's not just me. Have you seen Fionna? Oh, not yet. But if she's here, we'll find her. I know this place like the back of my mind. So, are you Finn's doppelganger? Hmm. Used to be. Yeah. I remember sort of dying in Ooo. But my consciousness awoke here. I tried to be Finn. I wanted what he had. His things, his life. Sounds familiar. But I'm something else.
[chomps]
Karmic Worm:  We're here. Is this your garden? Not exactly. But it is special to me. [whispers] Touch it.
[screaming]
Karmic Worm:  Finn?
[laughing]
Karmic Worm:  Enough arrows! Well, stop blocking. Kill! Kill! Kill!
[game sound effects playing]
Karmic Worm:  Yay! Huntress! You know, you could beat me at video games more often if we lived together.
[-[groans] -[BMO] Uh, who want to play]
Karmic Worm:  a different video game? Whoa. [yells] Jake!
[-[gasps] -You don't wanna see that one.]
Karmic Worm:  Trust me. Finn's a sad fruit medley. But the balls won't flow up. He's not ready to deal with those feelings. Is everyone's unprocessed junk down here?
[wings fluttering]
[whimpering]
Karmic Worm:  Go on now. Well, hello, Huntress. Witch Wizard! You followed me, dawg? I've been waiting for you. Did you drop something? Give it here. Whoops.
[clanging]
[chuckles]
Karmic Worm:  All those years guarding a buried cow when I could have been juicing on the greenest magic. And now it's all mine!
[laughing maniacally]
[growls]
[screams]
Karmic Worm:  Eat up, everyone. Oh, Bubba, you sure you don't want any? You and Dad have been working hard all day. I'm just popping out for a walk. These hotdogs are crap! But at least Starchy won't have to cook.
[munching]
Karmic Worm:  I know what you mean.
[munching]
Karmic Worm:  Poor Gary.
Venus Cosmic:  Prepare your earholes. [screams] No!
[-Ellis, tell them... -[humming loudly]]
Venus Cosmic:  ...go beyond the end of the peach. Poor Ellis. I think.
Hana:  Marshall, really. I ask for peace and quiet for one day and you whiff it. And now you're trying to make me feel guilty pulling that sad face. Sorry, Mom.
Hana:  You make things so difficult. Marshall. I can't believe she blew off the meeting.
[grunts]
Hana:  Maybe she just had a lot going on.
[sighs]
Hana:  Frank already had it out for me and now I'll never get him off my back. I just wish she would get her shit together.
[grunts]
Hana:  I've never heard them talk like that before. Are you okay? Maybe you should stop.
[giggling]
Hana:  There's enough dough for everyone to make biscuits.
[laughs]
Man:  Who's the kid?
Woman:  I don't know. She doesn't really talk to anyone but the cats. Boss doesn't mind. Says, "A stray is a stray."
Man:  Wow, that's sad.
Woman:  Hey, Larry brough doughnuts.
Man:  Hell yeah!
[grunts]
[growls]
Man:  Fionna!
[gasps]
[-[screams] -Fionna!]
[panting]
Man:  All I do is hurt everyone around me.
[sobbing]
[grunts]
[laughs]
[both grunting]
[-[screams] -[laughing maniacally]]
[grunts]
Man:  Oh, all right. Take five, Witch.
[-[scoffs] -You look busted.]
Man:  Shut up!
[laughing maniacally]
[grunting]
Man:  How'd you do that?
[grunting]
Man:  Why am I fighting you? This stolen magic is devouring you.
[growls]
[grunts]
[groans]
Man:  [straining] This is bullshit! You can't keep me down. I am a god here! Do you hear? A god!
[grunts]
Man:  I've really come to love this place. The only thing I miss is being around other deities. You're a goddess, right? Goddess?
[laughs]
Man:  Keep it up, honey. It's working. What's funny? You serious? I don't feel like a goddess. I feel like a freak. What? Why? I can stretch into anything. But it all seems wrong. Like I'm trying to be something I'm not. That's heavy. But there's no shame in it. Thoughts come here to transform. It's amazing. And not just because of what changes. The changes reveal what stays the same. And what's that? The truth. It might cycle through here a hundred times, take a hundred forms, but everyone is another chance to know it, like you, and the forms you take, just, wow. I'm so lucky you landed in my... life.

[both laughing]
Cake:  Fionna! I recognize this handywork. She's not alone.
Fern:  It's just a little further. Maybe I can just crawl under some sludge and stay there for the rest of my life. You don't want to live here. Hey, it's Fern. We have a visitor. Make that two. Cake! Fi! Is it just me or are you extra squishy? Baby, you have no idea. Is this worm a friend of yours? Oh, you're going to love him too. He basically shits therapy.
Fionna:  Thanks. Feel free to take a moment. You've come a long way. Is this tea his therapy? Oh, no. Though, honestly, I have no idea how he made that for you. This is a beautiful... pizza box. I wish I could spend more time here. I'm usually out taking care of the undergrowth. That's nice of you. It's kind of a prison sentence. [spits] Prison? Oh, my brother and I got pinched. I was banished here. But his punishment? His punishment was way worse than mine. But I can't bring myself to eat his regrets.
[weeping]
[gasps]
Fionna:  What's wrong? We know him. Really? Is he doing all right? I'm sure I only see the worst of it-- Baby, he's dead. Uh, what? I'm so sorry.
[weeping continues]
Fionna:  I deserve this. How could I have been so selfish? If I process his painballs now they'll have nowhere to go. This is all that's left of him. It's okay, hun, let it out. That's worth a try. You really are so brilliant! He flatters me. Our kind are like ideas. Hard to kill outright.
[both gasp]
Fionna:  Dude.
[-[orb cracking] -[weeping continues]]
Fionna:  Brother? Hey. Um... Do you still like pizza? It's really you! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for-- I'm happy here. I forgave you thousands of years ago. I've seen how much you've been hurting. But our work isn't done. I know. But I can't stand it anymore. Let me help you. It's okay to feel regret. When you do, know I'm here for you, wanting you to be whole, waiting until I can see you again. For you, Worm Brother. Keeping mum, eh? Your silence is only digging you a deeper grave.
[shrieks]
[all gasping]
Fionna:  Mistrial in the court!
[shrieks]
Fionna:  Holy dooley. Cosmic Owl, is that you? You look rank. I demand you let Finn go. I got shanked on purpose.
[-[gasps] -What the hell?]
Fionna:  Oh, okay. But now you're back, it'll be business as usual. Nah, I quit.
[straining]
Fionna:  See ya!
Orbo:  Oi, you can't do that!
Cosmic Owl:  You'll have to catch me first!
Orbo:  Aw, piss! You okay? Our meeting was perfect. Knowing that the guilt he's been carrying could finally be lifted, the way he didn't even hesitate to set things right. I'm so filled with pride and love for my brother. I messed up. I bjorked it up real bad! Baby, it's okay. It's not okay. But it's not too late to set things right.
Huntress:  No, it's not.
[gasps]
[whistles]
Huntress:  Time for you to go home, Fionna. What about you? And Finn? I lost the cure. Oh, no. It's for the best. I'll find another way. A better one. Fionna. Ready to get out of here? Actually, I was thinking of staying. Oh. Not forever. I just... I think I need to see what else this place has in store for me. And maybe get to know that fine worm a little better, too. I get it. But if you need me, you just say the word, Fi. You know I'm ride or die. The portal's over there. Get over here, girl. Thank you. For all the help. And, Fionna, you're not a broken tool. You're really great. You got this, girl. It's okay to be nervous.
[exhales]
Huntress:  [groans] You... Let me loose so I can give you a real ass kicking!
[spits]
Huntress:  We're heading back to Ooo. No, you can't. I'll have nothing! No powers! I'll be a nobody. You'll learn to be somebody again. What's going on?
Princess Bubblegum:  We can't risk losing him like that again. His organs have gotten significantly weaker. He could go at any moment now. There's no other choice.
[gun cocks]
Princess Bubblegum:  We have to call his mom. Hang on, Finn.
[shatters]
Princess Bubblegum:  No!
