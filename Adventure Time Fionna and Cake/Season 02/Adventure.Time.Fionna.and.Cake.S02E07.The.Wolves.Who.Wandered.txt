[snoring]
[grunting]
Fionna:  They're taking me again.
Spirit:  So you're back for another juicy taste from the sweet mango of my body.
Spirit:  I have an important message.
Fionna:  Oh, for me?
Spirit:  No.
Fionna:  What? But this is my encounter.
Spirit:  You'll know who my words are for when the time is right.
Fionna:  If it's not for me, I don't want it.
Spirit:  Prepare your ear holes.
[Fionna screams] No!
[speaking indistinctly, muffled]
Spirit:  Mm-hm-hmm.
[inaudible]
Spirit:  Get out of my headspace, honey.
Fionna:  Wait.
[opening theme music]
Fionna:  With DJ Flame headlining, we're definitely gonna make our goal. Thanks for helping out again, girls. Don't worry, Gare. The Sweet Spot will be ours again soon. Marsh, you're okay with playing a shorter set, right? Oh, yeah, sure. Awesome. Eh... no. Oh, my God, DJ Flame! I've got to tell everyone! Hey, Fi, you know, Marshall has been working really hard on his new songs. Aw, man. He's gonna be a great opener. A broken tool seeks the flame. Is it the heart that's broken? Do I need to burn it to get home? [sighs] Spirit, your clues are gray water backwash! Any sign of DJ Flame? No, but he knows there's a tech scout scheduled.
[- Okay. Well... - I think he wants me back.]
Fionna:  I mean, we almost kissed. But then he ran off. Yeah. Uh, Fi, honey, you tend to interpret things the way you want to. You saw his dream. He was all over me. One thing that's not open to interpretation is dreams. But still, I say use him and use... [blabbering] Hey, so we're just setting up a standard stage package, right? We need to get out of here in an hour. Phelix will tell you when he gets here. I'm sure he's just running late.
[phone trilling]
[phone trilling continues]
Fionna:  <i>It's Phelix. Do your thing.</i> Still not picking up. [screams] Boys' night is in two days. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You feel better? Fennel's trying to keep Flame away from me.
[- Who? - I need to rescue him]
Fionna:  from that knockoff's clutches. Whoa!
[- Maybe sleep on that idea. - What?]
Fionna:  Now, I'm sure we can set everything up tomorrow. You got this.
[snoring]
[groaning]
Fionna:  Fionna.
[chuckles]
[grunts]
[crowd booing]
[groaning]
[laughing maniacally]
Fionna:  I gotta fix this. L-M-N-O-P.
[banging at door]
Fionna:  Phelix! Get out here! Fionna? You! I knew it! Phelix! Phelix, where are you? He didn't come back. What? I've been waiting up all night. When was the last time that you saw him? A few days ago. I've checked everywhere. Slime hasn't seen him either. It's like he disappeared. I'm so worried about him.
[whirring and rattling]
[grunts]
[cats purring]
Fionna:  Should we call for a manhunt? Or a man huntress. I don't know that show. Huntress! Cake, what are you doing? You got dogs without me? We got hungry.
[gulps]
Fionna:  Is Huntress around?
[door creaks]
Fionna:  You gotta help us find DJ Flame. I'm not all that invested in the well-being of your former mate. Please, HW.
[inhales]
Fionna:  Fine, if it gets you out of my zone. Let me try something.
[strains]
Fionna:  These will give you wizard eyes, vision beyond vision to track your quarry. I don't mess with salad. It's not working. Well, give it a minute.
[munching]
Fionna:  Whoa. Whoa. Manhunt. Yes, dude.
[- Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.]
Fionna:  [both] Manhunt! Yeah, they had way too much. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. Whoa! Do you see that?
Fennel:  The busted rat-looking thing? [both] Let's follow it.
[panting]
Fennel:  No!
[- [thud] - [grunts]]
[groaning]
Fennel:  Fionna, look. [both] Wow! Ellis, what's going on with you? Just getting some tasty snackies for the squirrelies.
Fionna:  You're glowing. Hmm. Yeah, I get that a lot. [both] Wow! Purple. Fionna, you're freaking me out.
[footsteps]
Fionna:  My sweet M-Cron. That man is a horse. [both] Go to him! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Ellis, DJ Flame's gone missing. Ninety percent of the time a hottie goes missing around here, it's because they've been taken by aliens. And I got firsthand experience. But aliens aren't real. Believing is seeing.
[gasps]
Fionna:  After them. Where are those cowbells running now?
[smooch]
Fionna:  [both] Manhunt! It's Flame's aura.
[gasps]
[- [Fionna] Flame! - [Fennel] Phelix!]
[- Phelix! - Flame!]
Fionna:  We're here, babe.
[- Phelix! - [both coughing]]
Fionna:  Oh, nyah! Flame!
[yowls]
Fionna:  What the hell were you thinking running into a live burn? We're doing a drill. Huh? He has to be in there. Nuh-uh! Ow! Okay. Crabcake is putting you in timeout. Now, this is why you don't eat salad.
Fennel:  Magic chamber. Oh, my God, it smells good in here.
Fionna:  Cake. I gotta go get plant girl.
[- [banging] - [grunting]]
Fionna:  I don't get it. Are we doing wizard eyes bad? Feels like I'm doing a lot bad lately. Come on, you're doing your best. Meanwhile, everyone else around me has their junk figured out. Cake, Gary, Phelix, and Hunter. You just know they popped out of the womb like that. Eh, Hunter's had some messy, angry times too. Yeah, right. Like, real angry. They really had to focus on filling their cup and then expanding that cup for years. I'm proud of them. The Hunter you know, that took a lot of work, takes a lot of work. Oh, huh? Maybe if we focus all our intention on Phelix together, the wizard eyes will show us the way. Good idea.
[both inhales]
Fionna:  [both] Phelix. Huh?
[both gasp]
Fionna:  Ellis was right. [both] Take us to Phelix.
[screaming]
Fionna:  Dang it!
Spirit:  <i>A broken tool.</i> Flame will lead me to the heart. He must be located. Okay. Hey, I think they went this... What? I'm gonna bite her head off. Fionna. Flame. Where the bjork did he go? Did you see?
[whistles]
DJ Flame:  Yeah, yeah, for sure. That's too tempting an offer to pass up. Near Moore and Orange? I'll head right over. Be there in ten tops. Yo, marshmallow. Oh, it's you. Do you know a man called Moron Orange? Moron Orange? Oh, you mean Moore and Orange? It's an intersection uptown. Show me. I'm busy. With helping plants? Yes. Well, I'm a plant and I...
[groans]
[exhales]
DJ Flame:  I need your help.
[strumming guitar]
[doves cooing]
DJ Flame:  Come on! Shoo! Shoo! Er... Stop following me.
[hisses]
[grunts]
DJ Flame:  No, no, no, no. I work for your mom. My job is to keep you safe. I mean, don't you ever wonder why you never got kidnapped as a child?
[- No. - You're welcome.]
DJ Flame:  And remember that sketchy ice cream lady? Simone? Chased her off with the big guns and a restraining order. You what? Hana's orders. She flipped when I told her that woman was hugging on you. I was hugging her, you idiot! I love... I liked her. She was on the square. Heh, boy, is my face red.
[beeping]
[screaming]
DJ Flame:  Wow.
[screaming continues]
[panting]
DJ Flame:  Is this real?
[- [laughing] - [exclaims]]
DJ Flame:  Oh, I wanna clear my head so bad. It's gonna be okay, Fennel. We just have to find a friendly local. Oh! I can still feel the kiss of your hand on my cheek.
[- I'm so sorry. - Please.]
DJ Flame:  Eh... Allow me this intimacy. Whoa! Yes! See, Fennel, friendly local. This is Venus. We're all friendly here. Come, fiance.

[crowd cheering]
DJ Flame:  He creates love and lust, enough to power our mighty cities single-handedly. He is Flame. [both] Phelix! We object! Cold fish. I challenge you to a duel.
[crowd booing]
DJ Flame:  The engagement is off. A duel in the name of love.
[crowd cheering]
DJ Flame:  Hmm. [chuckles] Is all this really necessary? It's crucial. You can't enter the arena without love-enhanced suits. They're right, Fennel. Fighters need gear. Oh. I've never been in a fight before. I'm not a badass like you. Eh. I'm just impulsive and violent. I'm not a good fighter. Especially not compared to Finn. Excellent choice. This sword is a true classic.
[straining]
[crowd chattering]
[crowd booing]
DJ Flame:  Boo! Strange aliens from distant Earth, I will return your heart's desire if you can beat my champion. We'll take on your best fighter. Uh-uh. My best lover.
[metal creaking]
[crowd cheering]
DJ Flame:  Marry me! And now, embrace. [grunts] Hug this! Huh?
[laughing]
DJ Flame:  You're a terrible lover.
[smooch]
[grunts]
[Embolina laughs]
Embolina:  Come on, baby. Everything here is powered by love. I love swords.
[grunts]
Embolina:  The affection must be genuine, silly Eartho.
[crowd cheering]
Embolina:  Fionna, I love that you're so brave. And how you support your friends. You're incredible. I've admired you for so long.
[straining]
[- [Fionna] Guess what... - Huh?]
Embolina:  I genuinely love swords.
[- [crowd gasping] - Oh, no!]
Embolina:  Now do me. Eh... You have cool hair. What else? I just met you.
[straining]
Embolina:  I'm sorry. You're a good listener. You're so supportive. I'm glad Hunter has a friend like you.
[straining]
Embolina:  I didn't think we'd get along.
[grunting]
Embolina:  But I think I want to be your friend. I want to be your friend.
[grunting]
[pop, thuds]
[groans]
Embolina:  Let's get him.
[gasps]
[gasps]
Embolina:  Who would toss out perfectly healthy rose bushes? [man 1] Don't stop till they're wiped out. [man 2] Yes, sir. We need plenty of space to take care of our guest.
[laughing]
Embolina:  What's wrong? You're beautiful. So are you.
[both giggling]
[both screaming]
[Starchy straining]
Starchy:  [guard] Faster! This Flame guy's number is almost up.
[screaming]
Starchy:  They have Flame. I'll text Cake for backup. Why wait? You with me, gardener?
[electronic music playing]
Starchy:  Hey, mano, what are you doing? Oh, hey, I'm playing a gig. For who?
Lemoncarbs:  <i>♪ Happy birthday to Dog ♪</i> <i>♪ Happy birthday to... ♪</i> You crashed the party of our beautiful baby boy.
[- Ruined! - [screams]]
Lemoncarbs:  [both] This wasn't part of our deal, DJ! Fionna and Fen have been looking all over for you. Why did you flake?
[munching]
Lemoncarbs:  Oh, no, I was locked in on this mega set.
[speaking foreign language]
[grunts]
Lemoncarbs:  How could you be so... heartless? All you had to do was communicate. And this could have been avoided,
[- you ass! - [Cake] You ass!]
Lemoncarbs:  You were supposed to help me find Fionna and Fennel. Now they've disappeared into thin air and it's all your fault.
Lemoncarbs:  Boo, you! You're making our dog feel bad.
[whimpers]
Lemoncarbs:  Wait for me. You better show up tomorrow. Of course. I never miss a gig.
[Fionna screaming]
Fionna:  I killed Flame. I'm so sorry, Fennel. No. This is my fault, too.
[both crying]
[both groaning]
Fionna:  Oh, God! Flame! Did any of that actually happen?
[- Fionna! - Cake!]
Fionna:  Flame's been fine all this time. He'll be at the gig tomorrow. [both] Really? [both] Uh... [both] So that... Uh... I should probably get home. Good luck tomorrow. Yep.
[- [clears throat] - Huntress.]
Fionna:  I mulled it over. I will help you save your Sweet Spot. Aw! You are the tool I've been missing.
[- Oh... - [phone vibrating]]
Fionna:  You need to get a new phone.
[- Marshall? <i>- You got a minute?</i>]
Fionna:  Is something wrong?
[sighs in exasperation]
Fionna:  I don't want to have boys' night at the mausoleum. I just discovered something... messed up about my mom. <i>Oh, no.</i> Sorry. I know this is short notice, but... It's okay. I get it. I understand if you don't want to play. <i>You should</i> <i>sit this one out for sure.</i> What do you mean? Like, it's too late to change anything. If we pull out of the venue now, our fundraiser will fail. <i>I'm doing this for you.</i> Hello? Marshal?
