Fionna:  I slept terribly!
Cake:  You should've tried another dresser.
Cake:  Come and get it, Huntress!
Huntress Wizard:  Nice!
Huntress Wizard:  Where'd you get the fabric?
[gobbling]
Cake:  So, what's the game plan today, Fi?
Fionna:  Well, I lost the fundraiser venue.
Fionna:  But I can still fix it.
Cake:  And you got kicked out of your place.
Fionna:  I can fix that, too.
Fionna:  Just... later,
Fionna:  after meeting up with Flame.
[groans]
Fionna:  But first, we have to help Huntress!
Cake:  What was that heart thing you were looking for?
Huntress Wizard:  The heart of the forest.
Cake:  Yeah, but what is that?
Huntress Wizard:  It's the source of green magic.
[- And also a portal... - That's how you got here?]
Huntress Wizard:  I need to find the heart of this world to get back.
Huntress Wizard:  Do you have any ancient gnarly bushes or dark foreboding forests?
Fionna:  [muffled] Mm. Not really.
Fionna:  But I do know about the oldest tree in the city.
Huntress Wizard:  Take me now!

Marshall:  Sorry. Am I in the way?
Gary:  Not at all.
Gary:  I'm so hopped up on baking, I didn't even notice.
Marshall:  <i>♪ My baby-- ♪</i>
[mixer whirring]
Gary:  [shouting] Hey! Is this too loud?
Marshall:  Uh... No.
[whirring stops]
Marshall:  Hey! Do you need any help?
Gary:  Yes. Could you chop this baking chocolate?
Marshall:  No, no.
[- Huh? - This is nice.]
Gary:  But could you make them little squares?
Marshall:  Aren't you just gonna melt them anyways?
Gary:  Yes.
Gary:  Actually, you know what? I'll just do it.
Marshall:  Sorry.
Gary:  No. No worries.
Gary:  Why don't you help me fold some more napkin swans?
Gary:  My parents do it for the mints at the hotel.
[gasps] You haven't met my folks yet!
Marshall:  I mean... I'd like to someday.
Gary:  Well, I'm going over to their place tonight!
Gary:  You should come!
Marshall:  Uh... Okay.
Gary:  Okay!
Fionna:  And...
Fionna:  here we are!
Cake:  It's old as balls.
Huntress Wizard:  Hey. Don't you know trees can scream?
[screaming]
Cake:  Girl...
Huntress:  You're lucky to witness this. Cutting off your dang hand! Shh! Behold! Hmm. That was supposed to connect me... to the heart.
[cell phone vibrates]
Huntress:  Y-ello!
[- Marshall? - I'm freaking out, Fionna.]
Huntress:  Can we meet by the fountain? Uh... I kind of got a lot going on today, but I can make time. I'll be there all day.
[cell phone chimes, vibrates]
[Fionna reading]
Fionna:  "Cake, this is Gary. "Tell Fionna to meet me at Butler's Buttery Buns in 16 minutes." "Love, Gary. P.S. This is from Gary." Cake! Keep an eye on Huntress so she doesn't... you know... I'll be back as soon as I can. Why are we meeting here? I panicked! But I know we won't run into Marshall here. Are you guys okay? I don't know. It all happened so fast. I just blurted out an invitation. And I just agreed! What's Marshall gonna think about my childhood home? He grew up in a penthouse. Ah! I should've planned this more. Cleaned up the place, made a menu, done a trial run. Dude, that's crazy. I've never met anyone's parents before. He met my mom. And that was a disaster. If Gary's parents are anything like him, they'll love you. Bring flowers if you're worried. Home-cooked dinner, he's gonna love it. Maybe you're right. Thanks, Fionna. Thanks, Fionna. I gotta pee so bad.
[yawns]
Fionna:  Not what I expected.

Fionna:  [Cake reading] "I saw you on cheers. "Kudos for standing up for yourself!" Wow! It really is filmed live.

Fionna:  Let's keep this professional, girls.
[- Hey! - Hey, hey.]
Fionna:  I've been trying to get you on the phone. Oh, shoot! It's busted. I had a change of plans. You mind if this is a working lunch?
[clears throat]
Fionna:  That's how I usually lunch. All right, Business. Come on.
[pot shatters]
Fionna:  And that's my plan to save The Sweet Spot. Right on. My friends are amazing. So I cannot mess this up! I don't have leads on a venue, but I've got hookups for the equipment. Is that okay if I-- Whatever contacts you have, use 'em. Do whatever it takes to make it happen. Thanks. By the way, I passed by your old place. The Scarab really did a number on it. I moved to the towers... there. It's not flashy. All my money goes into this place. Make yourself at home. Hey, kid! I got your text. How's it goin'? Bad. Everything's comin' out trash. Aw, come on, man. Can you give it one more shot? Aw, he's so good with kids. I got just the beat for you.

Cake:  Where are we?
[- Ahh! - Hmm. Inconvenient.]
Cake:  Inconvenient? We must be inside the willow. Doesn't matter. I have to find my way home. No. I'm supposed to be getting fresh with M-Cron right now. Ugh! Once we get to Ooo, we can find a spell and fix this. Ahh! Hmm. Where do you think this goes? Curious... cat!

Cake:  [gasps] We're in Ooo.

[- Yeah! - [both cheering]]
Cake:  Oh, this is old Fionnaworld. When Simon lost his magic, everything got retconned by that glory wave. All that matters is that this tree isn't the heart of the forest. Ooh, child, let me out of this crazy tree! Let me just, uh...
[both gasping, grunting]
Cake:  [both] Bubba! Bubba? Sorry, we're late. Marshall wanted to take five busses and double-back three times to get here.
Gordie:  That sounds fun. Come in, come in! Whoa! So, you're "the Marshall Lee." [excitedly] So handsome! Woman, you already have two men. Let Gary have one. I'm teasing. They know I'm teasing.
[- [chuckles] These are for you. - Oh, wow!]
Gordie:  So fancy! My mom made me take ikebana classes as a kid. They're just lovely. [clears throat] Bubba. Did you, uh... bring anything? Just some little old rhubarb crumble. Nelly's favorite! [shouts] Nelly! It's your favorite! We're eating like royalty tonight. 'Cause we're the Princes. Remember how Bubba used to watch cooking shows all the time? [laughs] He was so cute. Oh, honey. Get the video. [nervously] Oh, Mom. Marshall doesn't wanna see that. Okay. Who's ready for a little Bubba showcase?
[- Me! - I'm his mother,]
Gordie:  so of course I'm ready!
Gordie:  Oh, this is his first batch of lemon bars.
Gertie:  He mixed up the sugar with the salt, but we ate 'em anyway. Bubba just loved taking care of Nelly.
Gordie:  Sure did. I mean, look at all the cookies he baked for his sister's school.
Gertie:  Aw, he fell asleep in them. [Gordie in video] <i>All right, Bubba, tear it up!</i>
[playing piano]
Gertie:  I didn't know you played. Oh, yeah. I took lessons for a bit, but... I got too busy. Bubba says you're a musician. We would love it if you'd play somethin'.

Cake:  Sweet baby. Oh! Demon baby. [chuckles] Oh. [grunts] Yes, yes, I hear you. Marshall! No! You've ruined your shorts. Sorry, Mom. This must be the way-way past. We seem to be traveling through different periods of your world, but only within this tree's lifetime.
[evil laughter]
Cake:  Wait! I've seen this movie before. If you ever end up in the past, you can't let a butterfly die! Sic 'em, kitty!

[beast snarls]
Cake:  Why did I squish that spider? It's your nature. All we can is deal with it in the present. And at present... I thirst. [gasps] This tastes like the rain from that janked-up future. This one!
[- Ready? - Hell no!]
Cake:  [sighs] I'm sorry I dragged you along tonight. Nah. Your parents were great. They... They really care about you. But... something's bothering you. I've just been thinking about how it was when I was a kid. Adults say they care, then suddenly they ghost you. Huh? Your mom never stops calling you. Never mind. You don't have to hide stuff from me. Even if it's about you? Of course! Like... I get why you're passionate about doing things a certain way. But sometimes when you get controlling about it,
[- you remind me of my mother. - Oh, God!]
Cake:  I'm not used to talking about what I want. You know, I express how I feel through baking. Perhaps that could be done with music, too. You're looking for new material anyway. Yeah. Maybe. You can make one about how I'm basically your mom. Okay, "Bubba."

Fionna:  I should go check in with Cake. Huh? [woman on loudspeaker] <i>All right, ladies!</i> <i>Who's ready</i> <i>to clear this dump?</i> [panting] What the hell? I thought I had till the end of the week to get you the money! Oh, yeah. [smacks lips] But then I remembered... [over loudspeaker] <i>I freakin' hate you!</i> <i>Go!</i> Stop! What if... What if we paid you more? 60K. Ha! There's no way you can do it. Plus, the people need parking. Did you know Hana Abadeer started her empire with just a few parking lots? Abadeer isn't stupid enough to let personal beef get in the way of a good deal! 70K. Ya have till Sunday. [over loudspeaker] <i>Shut her down, girls.</i>

Was it always this nasty? Pull around to the side. Fifi! Fifi? I chased out all the squatters, boss. Can't have all those elements around when we break ground for the new hotel. Hmm.
