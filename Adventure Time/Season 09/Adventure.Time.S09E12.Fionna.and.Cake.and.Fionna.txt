[The episode begins with Fionna and Cake on a river adventure. Chainsaws buzz as ghoul monsters transform.]
Fionna:  These ghoul dudes take the form of whatever you're thinking about.
Cake:  An angry -- no, shy shark baby.
Fionna:  What if life was always just constant fun times on the river? Let's never do anything boring ever again.
Cake:  Yes, let's never do anything boring ever ag--
[Beeping]
Fionna:  Time for Ice King's boring book reading.
Cake:  Aw, come on! He's just gonna read those weird stories that are basically about us.
Fionna:  I kind of dig getting loosely adapted.

[Scene changes to a library where Ice King holds a book reading.]
Ice King:  Fionna spoke with the voice of an angelic choir. "You can have the rest of the screaming chili cheese dip if you want," she said. [sniffles] "It's totally fine." The end. I said "the end"!
[Applause, chair squeaks]
Ice King:  Let's get some questions.
Audience Member:  Where do your ideas come from?
Ice King:  They're beamed into my melon at night -- same as everybody else. Next!
Woman:  I have more of a criticism than a question.
Ice King:  I am very open to criticism!
Woman:  Your story was completely wrong.
Ice King:  And how would you know?
Woman:  I know... because I am...
[Stick clacks]
Woman:  Fionna!
All:  [gasps]
Woman:  I can show you what really happened. It's all on this tape!
All:  Ooh!
Jake:  What format is that?

[The VCR begins playing a Fionna and Cake adventure.]
[VCR clicks, whirs]
Fionna:  According to this map, we're very close.
Cake:  Hey. Hey.
Fionna:  Hi. Hey.
Cake:  There's the door.
[Door knob rattles]
Fionna:  Aw, it's locked.
Cake:  I'll get us in with key...eye! Bam! "Eye" got it. You get it, Fionna?
Fionna:  Yeah, but it's a stretch.
[Laughter]
Cake:  There I am.
[Door creaks]
Fionna:  [sighs] Next time we find a map lying in the backyard, we should think twice.
Cake:  At least we get this fancy coffin. How's it look?
Fionna:  It's a decent addition to the treasure vestibule but still kind of a letdown.
Cake:  You know what's never a letdown? Cookie sauce review party.
Fionna:  Yeah! Cookie dip. Screaming chili cheese versus sriracha ranch.
[Lid creaks]

[Scene changes back to the library. The tape ends.]
[VCR clicks, whirs]
[Light switch clicks]
Jake:  Was it real? Who was filming all that?
Gunter:  Wenk, wenk.
Audience Member:  Needs more hunks!
Ice King:  Dude, I literally have one bazillion questions. Uh, excuse me, Miss Fionna... where did this video come fr-o-o-om!
Jake:  Fionna!
Ice King:  I always knew we'd meet one day and become best friends. So, uh, remember that time when Cake caught Ruse Goose, the notorious goose pickpocket?
Woman:  That was such a long time ago.
Ice King:  But during trial, you realized she was framed 'cause it was actually Abracadanielle pretending to be a goose all along!
Woman:  [hisses]
Jake:  Can I also ask a question?
Ice King:  Besties only.
Jake:  I was just gonna ask if we could see more of the tape.
Woman:  Oh, yeah, can we?
Ice King:  I don't think so.
Woman:  All right, just a little more.

[The VCR begins playing again.]
[VCR clicks, whirs]
[Lid creaks]
Fionna:  [yawns]
Cake:  Oh...my...glob. It's a mummy!
Mummy:  That's right. I'm a mummy!
Cake:  Aww. Yeah, you are. And a real cutie, too.
Mummy:  I'm not cute! I'm horrible! [groans menacingly]
Fionna:  Want to hang?

[Scene changes back to the library. Ice King pauses the tape.]
[VCR clicks, static crackles]
Ice King:  Okay, that's enough.
Ice King and Jake:  Aw!
Jake:  I want to see more.
Woman:  I don't want to wear it out. It's my only copy. And it's very important to me.
Librarian:  Library closes in five. Click, click, click.
[Light switch clicks]
Ice King:  So, where you heading now?
Woman:  Guess I'll go back to the dump under the bridge where I live. I'd invite you over, but I don't have a sofa or TV or anything. It's literally a dump.
Ice King:  I have a TV. My crib is equipped.
Woman:  Oh, really?
Ice King:  Hey, you should move in! Please live with me, Fionna.

[Scene changes to Ice King's castle. He gives the woman a tour.]
Ice King:  This is the sweet spot. My roo-- Oh! I wasn't expecting guests. [chuckles] Not that you mind a bit of dirt, right? Nice, huh?
Woman:  So, this is my room now.
Ice King:  Only the best for Fionna.
Woman:  Oh, yeah. I like this room, too. It's where I do all my deep thinking.
Ice King:  Man, I still can't believe it -- the Fionna in my bathroom, touching my toothbrush, throwing it into my little trash can. Fionna taking charge! That's what heroes do. You're a so much better hero than Finn.
Woman:  I know. Plus, don't tell Jake, but I've always been more of a cat person. Where is Cake the Cat?
Ice King:  Cake?
Woman:  Cake is gone. Some years back, there was an adventure mishap. I don't feel comfortable talking about it.
Ice King:  Oh, okay. Hey, you still haven't shown me where you keep your Fionna-and-Cake tapes.
Woman:  Sorry, no can do.
Ice King:  What? Don't you have tapes?
Woman:  Oh, yeah, I got loads of tapes, but they're super private.
Ice King:  Maybe you'll change your mind once you see more of my mummy adventure?
Woman:  Yay! I'll get snacks.

[The VCR plays more of the mummy adventure.]
[Static crackles]
[Laughter]
Mummy:  [groans]
Fionna:  Hey, what's wrong?
Mummy:  I have...a curse!
Cake:  Oh, no. How can we save you, tiny mummy?
Mummy:  The curse can only be broken by strong black coffee and fancy muffins from Breakfast Kingdom.
Fionna:  I know that place. It has a really long line on weekends.
Mummy:  Yes! That sounds like the one. Be a hero and fetch unto me the sacred breakfast.
Cake:  Don't you worry, little guy. We'll save you!
Mummy:  [laughs]

[The tape ends.]
[VCR clicks, static crackles]
Woman:  Okay, that's the end of the tape.
Ice King:  Really? My stories usually get wrapped up neater. [chuckles] Wrapped up -- mummies.
Woman:  Yeah, well, there's no more, so... You wouldn't know this, but old heroes need a lot of sleep.
Ice King:  I did know that. See you in the morning.
[Tape clicks]
[Click echoing, ominous tone plays]
Ice King:  Okay.

[That night, Ice King sneaks around the castle.]
Ice King:  Fionna? You awake? I made you a midnight snack.
Woman:  [snoring]
Ice King:  [munching] [sighs, snores]

[Ice King watches more of the tape alone.]
[VCR clicks, static crackles]
Fionna:  Mummy, we're home.
Ice King:  [gasps] I knew it. Where did it go?
Cake:  Maybe it had to go back into its coffin Dracula-style.
Fionna:  Mummy? We got your breakfast.
Cake:  Hmm.
[Coins rattling]
Fionna:  Shh! What's that?
Mummy:  Nyeh. That's our treasure! Stay away. You'll get cursed.
Cake:  [groans menacingly] I take the curse off of me and put it back on you.
Mummy:  You understand nothing of mummy curses!
Fionna:  Our treasure!
Cake:  Our muffins!
Mummy:  Uhh...do not look upon a naked mummy. It's bad luck.
Fionna and Cake:  Queen of Ooo?!
Queen of Ooo:  That's right. I snuck in here to pretend to steal your stash and teach you a valuable lesson. Never invite strangers into your home, no matter how cool they seem and are. You should be thanking me really.

[Ice King realizes the truth about the woman.]
[VCR clicks, whirs]
Ice King:  Of course. She didn't want me to see the end of the tape because she's not Fionna. She's...a mummy!
Woman:  Aah!
[Ominous music plays]
Ice King:  [whimpering]
Woman:  Come on. They're all just him?
Ice King:  Imposter! Reveal yourself!
Woman:  Aah!
Ice King:  [gasps] Knock it off!
Woman:  You're the knock-off!
Ice King:  What? You're not Fionna! How did you -- Show me your true form!
Woman:  Aha!
Ice King:  Huh? What kind of mummy are you supposed to be?
Woman:  No kind! I'm just an old lady.
Ice King:  Who likes to dress up as Fionna?
Woman:  It makes me feel confident, okay? Plus, I look really good in this outfit. Look, I used to be very shy... tinkering with my tech stuff all night, sleeping all day. But one evening, I intercepted a strange signal. I was mesmerized. I watched that tape like 100 times before I finally stepped out of my cave a new woman, determined to find more Fionna and Cake. I roamed Ooo for years with no luck. But then, I found out about you, and I hatched a plan to steal your tapes.
Ice King:  What? I don't have any Fionna and Cake tapes.
Woman:  I know! All of your tapes are filled with embarrassing diaries.
Ice King:  If I met them, I'd definitely record it.
Woman:  Fionna and Cake aren't real, you ding-dong! They're just, like, a TV show from the past or something.
Ice King:  You're the ding-dong, lady! You tricked an old, defenseless Ice King.
[Crying]
Woman:  Look, I didn't mean to hurt you.
Ice King:  You lied to me. Fionna would never lie -- never.
Woman:  Oh, glob, you're right. I'm not like Fionna. I'm the mummy!
[Wailing]
[Crying]
Gunter:  Wenk.
Ice King:  Huh?

[The next morning, Ice King stands outside the castle.]
Ice King:  Well, that was disheartening.
Woman:  [echoing] Forgive me, Fionna!
Ice King:  [yawns]
Fionna:  [echoing] Cake, what time is it?
Gunter:  Wenk.
