[Screams]

[ Shriek ]

[ Panting ]

Push through it,
Jake! Nine o'clock!

No. Yow!

Whoa! [ Grunts ]

Oof. They really don't want
anyone taking this egg!

I'm not an egg! I'm
just out of shape!

[ Shrieks ]

[ Shrieking ]

King Cockatrice!

Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

Always, bro!

[ Panting ]

Both: Jakesuit!

Hyah!

Perfect Synchronicity!

[ Beeping ]

Finn: Next time, that guy
will think twice about

opposing Finn and Jake!

Jake: He's dead, dude.

Uh-oh. Cocka-tikes!
On Copter-trikes?

Attackro-batical!

[ Thud ] Ooh.

[ Jake laughs ]

Whoo. I love you, Jake.

Cake! Please!

[Breathlessly] What the
heck is wrong with you?

[ Cake yowling ]

[ Gasps ]

What?

Wait! My cat's in there!

- Hey!
- Cake!

Where are you? [ Grunts ]

But I saw her...

Wuah! Ugh!

- [ Grunts ]
- Cake!

I don't sell cake!
Only ice cream!

Uff! Uh!

I'm sorry. Cake?

[ Panting ] Cake!

[ Cake meowing ]

Simon: I don't understand.

Why am I still here?

Kitty, are you the portal?

[ Meowing ]

Can't talk? Ooh. I know.

[ Meowing ]

Ah!

[ Meowing ] I'm just gonna...

[Raspy voice] Fionna!
Fionna! Where am I!?

Ugh! Let go!

[ Gasps ] Fionna?

Cake: Fionna! Save me, Fionna!

[ Gasps ]

Cake. You're real.

H-How did you get here?

Don't know!

There was song. I followed.

A song?

It sound like, uh, um...

[ Humming ]

[ Ice-cream truck music plays ]

- [ Gasps ]
- Where did you hear that?

Where did you... Aah!

[ Panting ]

No, no, no, no! Want out!

Bad Cake!

[ Pounding ]

Mr. Ice King! Sir? I can't
sleep without my book!

Please?

Let me out!

Door open! Door open!

[ Gasps ] Yes!

[ Gasps ]

[ Gasping ]

Mr. Ice King. Your cat
looks just like Cake!

[ Coughs ]

Door, close.

Fionna! Fionna!

Fionna?

Fionna?

Fionna! Wait!

[ Distorted warbling ]

[ Panting ]

Fionna!

Are you lost?

[ Panting ]

[ Screaming ]

Aaaaaaah!

[ Honking ] [ Chomp! ]

Ow! Ow!

[ Screaming ]

[ Panting ]

[ Birds chirping ]

[ Snoring ]

[ Grunts ]

Huh?

[ Laughing ]

Whoa!

[ Twinkle! ]

[ Chuckles ] Beauty!

[ Sighs ]

Nyehh.

[ Rustling ]

[ Whistling ] Aah!

Hey, hey, hey! Hehoh!

[ Shing! ]

[ Cackling ]

Yeahhh. That's
where I want to go.

Hey. Sorry I ran into you.

Do you want to
exchange information?

You talk, too?!

Ugh! Your voice is so harsh.

You know you have this
thing set to "dog," right?

[Voice tone changing]
Hey! Stop that!

What... are...
you... doooing?!

Come on.

Don't... touch my thing!

Wait. Go back. Go back!

[Cake voice] Yeah!
This feels right!

Right on. Your
voice, your choice.

Wow. I've never been able to say
what I want like this before.

Usually, I just meow, and my
human puts food in my bowl.

Or cleans my poop.

Oh, yeah, two-way
communication is great.

You can debate people,
respectfully disagree,

agree to disagree.

You can even sell things.

I sell... apples.

Hmm?

I am hungry.

[ Boing! ]

Oh, yeah. These
babies are cursed.

Didn't I say that part out loud?

What?! I don't
want to be tiny!

Whoa! Calm down!

If you come with
me to the market,

we can get you a magic enlarging
strawberry to un-curse you.

Everybody knows that.

Fine!

[ Birds cawing ]

Fionna: Cake! Cake! Caaaaaake!

Cake! Cake!

[ Laughter ]

Thanks to you two geniuses,
I've been searching for hours.

[ Glug! ]

She can't have gone far with
those stubby little legs.

- [ Grunts ]
- Yeah, she'll turn up.

I know this sounds nuts,

but I swear I saw her jump
into a sparkly blue... portal.

In an ice-cream cart.

You were right. That
does sound nuts.

Nah, man. Don't doubt
yourself. Listen to your guts!

[ Grunting ]

Look for the sparkly
blue portaaalll.

[ Snoring ]

[ Snoring ]

Look for the portal.

I'll do whatever it
takes. Cake needs me!

I thought I needed Fionna,

but I actually kinda
like being on my own.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Who's Fionna?

She's kind of like a big
clumsy cat I live with.

So she's your family?

Well, I love her, but she's
more like a bossy roommate.

Oh, yeah. My ex-roommates
were bossy, too.

I wasn't allowed to do anything
before I left the tree.

It'll be fun to make
my own decisions.

Yeah. So whaddaya wanna do?

Not farming cursed apples,
right? That's my thing.

Hm. I don't know!

I'll figure it out once I get
to the blue sparkly place.

Right now I'm just gonna
follow my instincts.

Hey. Look at this log
perfectly blocking our path.

Hmm...

[ Sniffing ]

Now my instincts tell
me something is off.

How do you figure?

[ Rustling ]

[ Evil laughter ]

Well, well, well!

If it isn't mister big shot!

Heh heh heh heh!

Oh, you guys again!

These are the sucky
roommates I told you about.

- Oh.
- Aah!

You're comin' back
with us, squirrel!

For the umpteenth time, no!
I've grown beyond the tree!

Then I guess it's time

for our umpteenth
attempted kidnapping.

Get him! [ Growls ]

Eat my bushy tail!

Ugh! Oh! Help!

Hey! Leave him alone!

Oww!

Kitten, are you
gonna make trouble?

[ Grunts ]

[Chanting] In the tree,
part of the tree...

In the tree, part of the tree.

No! No! I don't want to
go back to my old life!

That's not respectful!

[ Grunts ]

- Owww!
- Huh?

Noooo!

- Rowr!
- Ow!

Heh-heh!

- [ Grunts ]
- My soft underbelly!

[ Hisses ]

She's feral, boys!
Let's skedaddle!

[ All shouting ]

[ Grunts ] Ow!

Unh!

Thanks for saving me!

I can't believe we're
already best frien...

I just don't like bullies.

Now take me to those
magic strawberries.

- Shiny!
- Huh?

Yes, the market is
very, very ni...

Hey. Oh.

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Ha-haa! Caught up to ya!

Come on. My stall
is right up ahead!

- Hey, there!
- Took you long enough!

Sorry, friend. I ran
into some trouble.

But this hero saved my bacon.

I'm so glad you're safe.
Fruits are free for heroes!

I'll unload!

Ya got any strawbs?

Of course!

Ooh!

Woah woah woahaha! Yeah!

Oop! That's too big!

Catch!

Bleh.

Ha ha ha ha!

Try more!

They are all unique
and delicious!

Why are you like that?

You know, this
apple-trading life

isn't always as glamorous
as I make it out to be.

I mean, am I good at
pretending it is? Yes.

Is that healthy?
No. [ Laughs ]

But I feel like I didn't
choose the apples.

The apples chose me, y'know?

Literally, some apple guy
actually came up to me and said,

"This will be your life now,

and it will be a
life of loneliness."

So, in conclusion,

am I happy about living
my life in solitude?

Yes. But also no because
of all the solitude.

Oh! Back to your
regular size, huh?

Yes, but I like having options.

Now... on to the
blue sparkly place!

W-What?

Dang it. Why can't
I make friends?

mind is really at...

I clapped for you...

Um...

Ooh. They do not look happy.

Hey! We are not
happy with you!

What did you do to
Hot Dog Knight #7?!

I don't know. I'm
working on instinct.

[ Whimpers ]

I'm new here?

Do you even know what "here" is?

- Cake!
- Squirrel!

Get big!

Welp. I'm out of ideas.

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Fiii-onna!

Eh...

[ Horn honks ]

Eh...

Yeah. I've seen it.

I've...

[ Snoring ]

[ Keys jingling ]

Gary? Aah!

Cheese doodles, Fionna! You
scared me half to death!

What are you doing?

Just, uh, gotta get that
morning dough started.

Hey. Have you seen Cake?
She ran away yesterday.

Possibly into this portal.

Oh, no. I'm sorry, Fionna.
Is there anything I can do?

A frozen triple-shot
latte would be nice.

Absolutely! Come in. Come in.

Maybe you should take a nap.

Nah. I'm good.

[ Liquid pouring ]

Thanks.

I'm gonna get started, and
then we'll scour the city!

Simon: Reveal the path
and grant me passage.

Reveal the path and
grant me passage.

Reveal the path and
grant me passage.

Reveal the path and
grant me passage.

Aah! Gary! Too much ice!

[ Twinkling ]

Ice. Blblblblblb!

[ Twinkling ]

Reveal the path and
grant me passage.

Reveal the path and
grant me passage!

Reveal the path and
grant me passage!

Cake?

Reveal the path... Aah!

Whoa! It was a portal!

To an apartment?

Oh, my God! Sir? Dude?

[ Shing! ]

Ice Prince?

Huh? Fionna?

You're not real!

Listen. Did you see a
cat come through here?

You're not real!

You're just a manifestation
of Ice King's madness!

[ Muffled shouts ]

You! You did this, ya goose!

- Aah!
- Is that what you wanted?!

This was my last
chance to see her!

Knock it off!

My last... chance.

I'm-a just, um...

Cake?!

[ Grunting ]

What kind of weirdo
lives in a garage?!

[ Grunting ]

Holy cow!

I'm in a whole other world!

Hahahahaha!

Hey, you! Have
you seen my cat?

Is it cute? I saw a real
cute yellow one yesterday.

It looked just like Cake
from my favorite book series.

That's her! Cake!

[ Gasps ] You're
an F&C fan, too!

Hey. If you have something
of hers, this can find her.

Oh. I don't usually
carry cat stuff.

Except... [ Spits ]

I'll just, uh... take one.

[ Zap ]

[ Beeping ]

That way.

Thanks!

[ Screech! ]

Hop on! Fans gotta
stick together!

Okay.

[ Whirring ]

Holy shhmowzow!

Gnah!

I'm Astrid, by the way. I was
born and raised in the city.

I'm Fionna. I'm from nowhere.

Fionna. You're so
method. I love it.

But you're missing something.

Much better!

Welcome to Ooo, Fionna.

I think you're
gonna like it here.

Yeah. Me too.

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Uh-oh. Where is she?

- Ouch!
- Cake!

Can I help? Keep
the bike runnin'!

- Take this! Ya like that?!
- Cake!

- Take that!
- Unh! Ah!

Get away from my cat! Hyaaah!

Fionna, just pull the pin!

Unh! You can talk?

I know. This place is nuts!

Oh, my God! This is one
of my top three fantasies!

Fionna, the pin!

Oh, shoot. Sorry!

Fionna!

I thought I'd lost you forever!

Aah! Me too!

Boo! No happy reunions
for the criminal!

Tammy, go get the
market bazooka.

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Cake, hold onto me.

You better back off!

Yeah? Or what?

Or this! Yaaaaah! Oof!

Ugh.

Ha! You suck! Unh!

- Fionna. Behind you!
- Yah!

W-Wait. Time-out. My buns!

Come on, freaks!

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Snarl! I showed up late.
W-What are we doing? Augh!

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Yah! Eat rocks!

Ha ha! I kick ass!

Yeah, you do!

This whole deal
just... feels so right!

[ Gasps ]

Oh, my gosh! You really
are Fionna and Cake!

The real ones! Can we
go on an adventure?!

Heh. Well...

Awww. My hat!
