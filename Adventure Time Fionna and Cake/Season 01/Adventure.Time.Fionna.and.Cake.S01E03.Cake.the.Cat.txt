[Screams]

[Shriek]

[Panting]

Fionna:  Push through it, Jake! Nine o'clock!

Cake:  No. Yow!

Jake:  Whoa! [Grunts]

Finn:  Oof. They really don't want anyone taking this egg!

Cake:  I'm not an egg! I'm just out of shape!

[Shrieks]

[Shrieking]

Fionna:  King Cockatrice!

Fionna:  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Cake:  Always, bro!

[Panting]

Both:  Jakesuit!

Finn:  Hyah!

Both:  Perfect Synchronicity!

[Beeping]

Finn:  Next time, that guy will think twice about opposing Finn and Jake!

Jake:  He's dead, dude.

Cake:  Uh-oh. Cocka-tikes! On Copter-trikes?

Finn:  Attackro-batical!

[Thud] Ooh.

[Jake laughs]

Finn:  Whoo. I love you, Jake.

Jake:  Cake! Please!

[Breathlessly] What the heck is wrong with you?

[Cake yowling]

[Gasps]

Fionna:  What?

Fionna:  Wait! My cat's in there!

Hey!
Fionna:  Cake!

Fionna:  Where are you? [Grunts]

Fionna:  But I saw her...

Fionna:  Wuah! Ugh!

[Grunts]
Fionna:  Cake!

Simon:  I don't sell cake! Only ice cream!

Cake:  Uff! Uh!

Fionna:  I'm sorry. Cake?

[Panting] Cake!

[Cake meowing]

Simon:  I don't understand.

Simon:  Why am I still here?

Fionna:  Kitty, are you the portal?

[Meowing]

Fionna:  Can't talk? Ooh. I know.

[Meowing]

Fionna:  Ah!

[Meowing] I'm just gonna...

[Raspy voice] Fionna! Fionna! Where am I!?

Cake:  Ugh! Let go!

[Gasps] Fionna?

Cake:  Fionna! Save me, Fionna!

[Gasps]

Fionna:  Cake. You're real.

Fionna:  H-How did you get here?

Cake:  Don't know!

Cake:  There was song. I followed.

Fionna:  A song?

Cake:  It sound like, uh, um...

[Humming]

[Ice-cream truck music plays]

[Gasps]
Fionna:  Where did you hear that?

Cake:  Where did you... Aah!

[Panting]

Fionna:  No, no, no, no! Want out!

Fionna:  Bad Cake!

[Pounding]

Fionna:  Mr. Ice King! Sir? I can't sleep without my book!

Fionna:  Please?

Fionna:  Let me out!

Fionna:  Door open! Door open!

[Gasps] Yes!

[Gasps]

[Gasping]

Fionna:  Mr. Ice King. Your cat looks just like Cake!

[Coughs]

Door, close.

Fionna! Fionna!

Cake:  Fionna?

Cake:  Fionna?

Fionna! Wait!

[Distorted warbling]

[Panting]

Cake:  Fionna!

Are you lost?

[Panting]

[Screaming]

Aaaaaaah!

[Honking] [Chomp!]

Ow! Ow!

[Screaming]

[Panting]

[Birds chirping]

[Snoring]

[Grunts]

Huh?

[Laughing]

Whoa!

[Twinkle!]

[Chuckles] Beauty!

[Sighs]

Nyehh.

[Rustling]

[Whistling] Aah!

Hey, hey, hey! Hehoh!

[Shing!]

[Cackling]

Yeahhh. That's where I want to go.

Hey. Sorry I ran into you.

Do you want to exchange information?

You talk, too?!

Ugh! Your voice is so harsh.

You know you have this thing set to "dog," right?

[Voice tone changing] Hey! Stop that!

What... are... you... doooing?!

Come on.

Don't... touch my thing!

Wait. Go back. Go back!

[Cake voice] Yeah! This feels right!

Right on. Your voice, your choice.

Wow. I've never been able to say what I want like this before.

Usually, I just meow, and my human puts food in my bowl.

Or cleans my poop.

Oh, yeah, two-way communication is great.

You can debate people, respectfully disagree,

agree to disagree.

You can even sell things.

I sell... apples.

Hmm?

I am hungry.

[Boing!]

Oh, yeah. These babies are cursed.

Didn't I say that part out loud?

What?! I don't want to be tiny!

Whoa! Calm down!

If you come with me to the market,

we can get you a magic enlarging strawberry to un-curse you.

Everybody knows that.

Fine!

[Birds cawing]

Fionna:  Cake! Cake! Caaaaaake!

Cake! Cake!

[Laughter]

Thanks to you two geniuses, I've been searching for hours.

[Glug!]

She can't have gone far with those stubby little legs.

[Grunts]
Yeah, she'll turn up.

I know this sounds nuts,

but I swear I saw her jump into a sparkly blue... portal.

In an ice-cream cart.

You were right. That does sound nuts.

Nah, man. Don't doubt yourself. Listen to your guts!

[Grunting]

Look for the sparkly blue portaaalll.

[Snoring]

[Snoring]

Fionna:  Look for the portal.

Fionna:  I'll do whatever it takes. Cake needs me!

Jake:  I thought I needed Fionna, but I actually kinda like being on my own.

Cake:  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Who's Fionna?

Cake:  She's kind of like a big clumsy cat I live with.

Simon:  So she's your family?

Jake:  Well, I love her, but she's more like a bossy roommate.

Simon:  Oh, yeah. My ex-roommates were bossy, too.

Simon:  I wasn't allowed to do anything before I left the tree.

Simon:  It'll be fun to make my own decisions.

Jake:  Yeah. So whaddaya wanna do?

Cake:  Not farming cursed apples, right? That's my thing.

Simon:  Hm. I don't know!

Fionna:  I'll figure it out once I get to the blue sparkly place.

Fionna:  Right now I'm just gonna follow my instincts.

Cake:  Hey. Look at this log perfectly blocking our path.

Jake:  Hmm...

[Sniffing]

Cake:  Now my instincts tell me something is off.

Finn:  How do you figure?

[Rustling]

[Evil laughter]

Cake:  Well, well, well!

Cake:  If it isn't mister big shot!

Cake:  Heh heh heh heh!

Owl:  Oh, you guys again!

Owl:  These are the sucky roommates I told you about.

Oh.
Fionna:  Aah!

Cake:  You're comin' back with us, squirrel!

Owl:  For the umpteenth time, no! I've grown beyond the tree!

Cake:  Then I guess it's time

Owl:  for our umpteenth attempted kidnapping.

Cake:  Get him! [Growls]

Squirrel:  Eat my bushy tail!

Owl:  Ugh! Oh! Help!

Fionna:  Hey! Leave him alone!

Owl:  Oww!

Fionna:  Kitten, are you gonna make trouble?

[Grunts]

[Chanting] In the tree, part of the tree...

In the tree, part of the tree.

No! No! I don't want to go back to my old life!

That's not respectful!

[Grunts]

Owl:  Owww!
Huh?

Noooo!

Rowr!
Owl:  Ow!

Heh-heh!

[Grunts]
My soft underbelly!

[Hisses]

She's feral, boys! Let's skedaddle!

[All shouting]

[Grunts] Ow!

Cake:  Unh!

Fionna:  Thanks for saving me!

Cake:  I can't believe we're already best frien...

Fionna:  I just don't like bullies.

Cake:  Now take me to those magic strawberries.

Fionna:  Shiny!
Huh?

Cake:  Yes, the market is very, very ni...

Fionna:  Hey. Oh.

[Indistinct conversations]

Cake:  Ha-haa! Caught up to ya!

Jake:  Come on. My stall is right up ahead!

Hey, there!
Cake:  Took you long enough!

Jake:  Sorry, friend. I ran into some trouble.

Jake:  But this hero saved my bacon.

Fionna:  I'm so glad you're safe. Fruits are free for heroes!

Cake:  I'll unload!

Fionna:  Ya got any strawbs?

Jake:  Of course!

Fionna:  Ooh!

Jake:  Woah woah woahaha! Yeah!

Cake:  Oop! That's too big!

Cake:  Catch!

Fionna:  Bleh.

Jake:  Ha ha ha ha!

Cake:  Try more!

Cake:  They are all unique and delicious!

Fionna:  Why are you like that?

Cake:  You know, this apple-trading life isn't always as glamorous as I make it out to be.

Cake:  I mean, am I good at pretending it is? Yes.

Cake:  Is that healthy? No. [Laughs]

Cake:  But I feel like I didn't choose the apples.

Cake:  The apples chose me, y'know?

Cake:  Literally, some apple guy actually came up to me and said,

Cake:  "This will be your life now, and it will be a life of loneliness."

Cake:  So, in conclusion, am I happy about living my life in solitude?

Cake:  Yes. But also no because of all the solitude.

Fionna:  Oh! Back to your regular size, huh?

Cake:  Yes, but I like having options.

Fionna:  Now... on to the blue sparkly place!

Cake:  W-What?

Finn:  Dang it. Why can't I make friends?

[Shouting gibberish]

[Weakly] My, my.

Ice King:  You care so much if I should live or die.

Ice King:  You're nothing but a spell battery to me.

Ice King:  And you probably only have one good jolt left in you.

Ice King:  I know where your mind is really at...

Cake:  Thinking about a girl and her cat!

[Chuckles]

[Muffled chuckle]

Simon:  This time, I won't think about Fionna and Cake.

[Coughs]

Cake:  I clapped for you...

Fionna:  Um...

Finn:  Ooh. They do not look happy.

Hot Dog Knight (or group of knights):  Hey! We are not happy with you!

Hot Dog Knight (or group of knights):  What did you do to Hot Dog Knight #7?!

Fionna:  I don't know. I'm working on instinct.

[Whimpers]

Fionna:  I'm new here?

Cake:  Do you even know what "here" is?

Fionna:  Cake!
Fionna:  Squirrel!

Cake:  Get big!

Finn:  Welp. I'm out of ideas.

[Indistinct shouting]

Cake:  Fiii-onna!

Fionna:  Eh...

[Horn honks]

Fionna:  Eh...

Cake:  Yeah. I've seen it.

Fionna:  I've...

[Snoring]

[Keys jingling]

Gary:  Gary? Aah!

Cake:  Cheese doodles, Fionna! You scared me half to death!

Fionna:  What are you doing?

Gary:  Just, uh, gotta get that morning dough started.

Fionna:  Hey. Have you seen Cake? She ran away yesterday.

Fionna:  Possibly into this portal.

Gary:  Oh, no. I'm sorry, Fionna. Is there anything I can do?

Fionna:  A frozen triple-shot latte would be nice.

Gary:  Absolutely! Come in. Come in.

Gary:  Maybe you should take a nap.

Fionna:  Nah. I'm good.

[Liquid pouring]

Fionna:  Thanks.

Cake:  I'm gonna get started, and then we'll scour the city!

Simon:  Reveal the path and grant me passage.

Simon:  Reveal the path and grant me passage.

Simon:  Reveal the path and grant me passage.

Simon:  Reveal the path and grant me passage.

Cake:  Aah! Gary! Too much ice!

[Twinkling]

Simon:  Ice. Blblblblblb!

[Twinkling]

Simon:  Reveal the path and grant me passage.

Simon:  Reveal the path and grant me passage!

Simon:  Reveal the path and grant me passage!

Fionna:  Cake?

Simon:  Reveal the path... Aah!

Fionna:  Whoa! It was a portal!

Fionna:  To an apartment?

Fionna:  Oh, my God! Sir? Dude?

[Shing!]

Fionna:  Ice Prince?

Simon:  Huh? Fionna?

Fionna:  You're not real!

Simon:  Listen. Did you see a cat come through here?

Fionna:  You're not real!

Simon:  You're just a manifestation of Ice King's madness!

[Muffled shouts]

Cake:  You! You did this, ya goose!

Fionna:  Aah!
Simon:  Is that what you wanted?!

Fionna:  This was my last chance to see her!

Cake:  Knock it off!

Simon:  My last... chance.

Finn:  I'm-a just, um...

Fionna:  Cake?!

[Grunting]

Fionna:  What kind of weirdo lives in a garage?!

[Grunting]

Fionna:  Holy cow!

Fionna:  I'm in a whole other world!

Cake:  Hahahahaha!

Fionna:  Hey, you! Have you seen my cat?

Cake:  Is it cute? I saw a real cute yellow one yesterday.

It looked just like Cake from my favorite book series.

Fionna:  That's her! Cake!

[Gasps] You're an F&C fan, too!

Simon:  Hey. If you have something of hers, this can find her.

Fionna:  Oh. I don't usually carry cat stuff.

Cake:  Except... [Spits]

Fionna:  I'll just, uh... take one.

[Zap]

[Beeping]

Cake:  That way.

Fionna:  Thanks!

[Screech!]

Cake:  Hop on! Fans gotta stick together!

Fionna:  Okay.

[Whirring]

Fionna:  Holy shhmowzow!

Astrid:  Gnah!

Astrid:  I'm Astrid, by the way. I was born and raised in the city.

Fionna:  I'm Fionna. I'm from nowhere.

Astrid:  Fionna. You're so method. I love it.

Astrid:  But you're missing something.

Fionna:  Much better!

Cake:  Welcome to Ooo, Fionna.

Cake:  I think you're gonna like it here.

Fionna:  Yeah. Me too.

[Indistinct shouting]

Fionna:  Uh-oh. Where is she?

Ouch!
Fionna:  Cake!

Cake:  Can I help? Keep the bike runnin'!

Finn:  Take this! Ya like that?!
Fionna:  Cake!

Finn:  Take that!
Unh! Ah!

Fionna:  Get away from my cat! Hyaaah!

Cake:  Fionna, just pull the pin!

Fionna:  Unh! You can talk?

Cake:  I know. This place is nuts!

Fionna:  Oh, my God! This is one of my top three fantasies!

Cake:  Fionna, the pin!

Fionna:  Oh, shoot. Sorry!

Cake:  Fionna!

Cake:  I thought I'd lost you forever!

Fionna:  Aah! Me too!

Finn:  Boo! No happy reunions for the criminal!

The Duke of Nuts:  Tammy, go get the market bazooka.

[Indistinct shouting]

Fionna:  Cake, hold onto me.

Fionna:  You better back off!

Cake:  Yeah? Or what?

Cake:  Or this! Yaaaaah! Oof!

Fionna:  Ugh.

Cake:  Ha! You suck! Unh!

Fionna. Behind you!
Finn:  Yah!

Taako:  W-Wait. Time-out. My buns!

Fionna:  Come on, freaks!

[Indistinct shouting]

Cake:  Snarl! I showed up late. W-What are we doing? Augh!

[Indistinct shouting]

Fionna:  Yah! Eat rocks!

Fionna:  Ha ha! I kick ass!

Cake:  Yeah, you do!

Fionna:  This whole deal just... feels so right!

[Gasps]

Finn:  Oh, my gosh! You really are Fionna and Cake!

Finn:  The real ones! Can we go on an adventure?!

Fionna:  Heh. Well...

Cake:  Awww. My hat!
