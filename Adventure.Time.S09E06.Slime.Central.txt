Okay, we'll find the crown,grab the jewel,

and then give a couple tugs on the skyhooks!

Got it!

Here's some trail mix for the road!

You think Betty and Simon hanging out is a good thing?

Totally.

They're two wackadoo peas in a wackadoodle pod.

Something about it makes me feel weird in the ethics.

Well, you don't want to stareat happiness too hard, you know?

Why?

'Cause it stares back, man.

Slime Town is mad nasty.

Let's blend in.

Yeesh.

This smells like the locker room of a gym for dead fish.

Eh, you get used to it,though.

That's the great thing about smells.

Man, where is everyone?

[ Bass thumping ]

Skate size?

Uh, 10.

Universal.

Aw, man!

Okay, you look dope.

[ Music blares ]

[ Gasps ]

Whoa.

Slime Princess got big.

Ah.

[ Cheers and applause ]

And the winner is...

Wawa!

Snack Pack!

As always, the prize is absorption

into the body of our bumpin' leader.

[ Crowd chanting"Skate to assimilate!" ]

[ Laughter ]

Isn't assimilation amazing?

No! It's horrifying.

It might be comfy,

like a hug that turns you into a hug.

What happens to the losers?

They go in the losers' cage,

and they're stripped of their skating rights!

Oh.

New plan!

‐We enter the contest...‐Yeah.

‐...win...‐Of course.

...then I grab the jewel

and you stretch us on out of that bod.

Won't we get absorbed,though?

We'll just believe in ourselves way too much.

She can't absorb us if we're self‐absorbed.

Okay, but you needa three‐person team to compete,

and I'm taken!

What?

Abracajamiel can do the splits.

Whoo!

Whatever!

Nyah!

Attention,super cool party people!

Huh!Hold onto me.

What?!

It's like being in a warm bathfull of snot.

Aah! We're trapped!

It'll work out somehow.

[ Gasps ] Jake, no!Fight the slime!

I'm havingthe slime of my life.

[ Chuckles ]

Jake.

I may as wellgive in to it.

Maybe Simonwill save Ooo.

This isn't an upliftingunderdog ending.

You're still here?

I'm not assimilating.

And no one can see my cool outfit

through all this lumpin's slime.

[ Groans ]

Looks like LSP is too much of a killjoy for our Slime Queen!

She's gonna be rejected!

Aah!

[ Both groan ]

Em‐Em‐Em‐Embarrassing!

Y'all are bounced.

Jerks.

I got the jewel, but I lost Jake.

[ Warbles ]

You're not a Slime person?

No, I totally faked it.

I just saw this lumpalicious party,

and I was like,"These are my people!"

But even though I shoplifted this super‐cool outfit,

I still didn't fit in.

I guess I don't fit in...anywhere!

[ Crying ]

Jake could fit in anywhere.

Whatever happened,he was always like,

"It'll work out."

Stop being so selfish, Finn!I'm the one hurting here!

You don't even know what it's like to be an underdog.

You and Jake always win ‐‐always!

You're right, LSP.We do.

Don't worry, Jake!I vow to get you back in shape.

[ Gasps ]

Oh, my Glob,this is it!

The crowd‐pleasing climax

where the beautiful underdoggets the hunk.

Rom‐com style!
