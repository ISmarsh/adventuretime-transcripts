[The episode begins with Finn and Fern fishing by a lake. An electronic hum comes from Finn's robot arm.]
Fern:  Squish. Photosynthesize! Photosynthesize! Photo--
Finn:  You grabbing a snack, Fern?
Fern:  Yeah. Water and light combine so I can make my own food. In case I don't catch anything.
Finn:  Come on, man. Don't be so dow --
[Reel clicks, squeaks]
Finn:  [gasps] Hey, I got something!
[Reel clicking]
Fern:  Hey, I got something, too!
Finn:  Nice.
[Grunts]
[Growling]
Fern:  Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Finn:  [sighs] Pretty weird fish, huh?
Fern:  That's me -- the dude who dinks it up, just like I dinked it up when you left Ooo. I was supposed to protect it. Instead, it went all crazy. I didn't even help. I just covered myself in root beer and danced around like a dummy. I can't do anything right!
Finn:  Hey, stop it. You need a squoze?
Fern:  Yes.
Finn:  [grunts]
Fern:  I feel better.
Finn:  Sometimes being a good dude ain't about not dinking it. Learn from your dinks. Like, you know my first battle with a giant? I never told anybody this, but --
Fern:  You boom-boomed in your shorts. I know. I have your memories.
Finn:  Yeah, I boom-boomed. The point is I learned from it, and now I'm Finn. You got to learn how to be Fern.

[Loud stomping and rumbling approaches.]
Finn and Fern:  What's that sound?
Finn:  Oh, I bet it's a monster. Let's fight this dude Fern's way.
Fern:  Yeah. Fern's way.
[Stomping, rumbling continue]
Sweet P:  Aaaaah!
Finn and Fern:  Sweet P?
Sweet P:  Waaaah!
Finn and Fern:  Whoa!
Sweet P:  Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Finn and Fern:  [gasp]
Sweet P:  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Finn:  Okay, Fern, what do you think we should do next?
Fern:  Mm, sever his tendons?
Finn:  [winces]
Fern:  Before you say no, it would stop him from running.
Finn:  We're gonna handle this librarian style.
[Crying]
Finn:  [whispering] Shh. Librarian. Kiss. You can renew the book and bring it back next week.
Fern:  Library style. Squ-o-o-oze.
Sweet P:  Ooh. Mm.
Finn:  Great thinking, Fern.
Fern:  I just copied you. Is that thinking?

[Finn and Fern ask Sweet P what's wrong.]
Finn:  What up, buttercup? Why you run, pork bun?
Sweet P:  The monster!
Fern:  Was it LSP?
Sweet P:  The monster that whispers me bad thoughts.
[Indistinct whispering]
[Whispering stops]
Sweet P:  Mommy and Daddy came to save me, but they said I was imagining things, which was true.
[Indistinct whispering]
Sweet P:  But last night, I really did see it.
[Screams]
Sweet P:  And I've been running and running since then.
Fern:  Aww, Sweet P. It sounds like you might just be having bad dreams.
Sweet P:  No, I only have one dream anymore.
[Indistinct whispering]
Finn:  Uhh...
Sweet P:  But the whisper monster is even scarier, saying stuff like, "Sweet P, you're bad. You always have been bad." I don't want to be bad.
[Crying]
Finn:  Oh, you're not bad. You're super good. Now, let's get you home.
Fern:  But it's getting late, and bogs are super dangerous to travel in at night.
Finn:  Your body will be preserved for thousands of years. No one will ever find you.
Sweet P:  [wailing]
Finn:  Fern!
Fern:  Okay, okay, we'll see you in the morning, Tree Trunks.
[Telephone beeps]
Finn:  All right, bedtime, Sweet P.
Fern:  You want me to knock him out?
Finn:  Er, not this time. How about a bedtime story?
Sweet P:  Yes, please.
Finn:  Once there was a kingdom of spaghetti.
Sweet P:  Mmm.

[That night, Sweet P sleeps while Finn and Fern keep watch. Insects chirp.]
[Snoring]
Sweet P:  [whispering] Punch, punch. Kiss, kiss.
The Lich:  Listen to your bones.
Sweet P:  Fern.
[Teeth clicking]
Finn:  Fern!
Fern:  [gasps] Hey. What's up?
Finn:  I heard something. Can you see what it is with your tree senses?
Fern:  I don't have those.
[Rustle, footsteps]
Finn:  Uh, can I help you?
Fox:  Oh, sorry. We heard you scuttling around and thought --
Fern:  What? You didn't hear me "scuttling around." Foxes are silent hunters. I mean, geez, do you know how rude that is? [groans] Gonna be brooding about this all week.
Finn:  Sorry, man.

[The Lich's hand attacks Sweet P.]
[Indistinct whispering]
Fern:  Look.
[Whispering continues]
Finn:  Aah! Get off him!
Lich Hand:  Huh?
Finn:  Aah!
Fern:  [grunts] I got him!
Finn:  Oh, no. I know where I've seen that thing before.
[Ominous tones play]
Lich Hand:  Huh?
[Laughs evilly]
BMO:  Finn, Jake! What's shaking?
Finn:  You will not believe what just happened.
BMO:  It must've been the day that BMO found that little sailor hat.
Finn:  Hold him down, Fern! That hand is the flippin' Lich!
Fern:  I know.
Lich Hand:  [chuckles evilly] Yes, child. I returned once more to --
BMO:  Bah! Bah! Bah! Bah! Evil!
Finn:  You're gonna get it for messing with our boy Sweet P.
Lich Hand:  That vessel may appear harmless, but he came from me. Once I remind him of his legacy, The Lich shall reign once more. Isn't that right, son?
Sweet P:  Aah!
Fern:  Finn!
Lich Hand:  [laughs evilly]
Fern:  Ugh! I dinked it again!
Finn:  [grunts]
[Panting]
Sweet P:  Why did Mr. Hand call me "son"? Was that my monster daddy?
Finn:  Okay, delegate, delegate -- Fern, stay here and guard Sweet P. I'm gonna try and catch up.
Fern:  Don't trust me to guard anything. I'm a total scrub-up.
Finn:  Dude, there's already one Lich loose in Ooo. If Sweet Pea turns e-v-i-l tonight, there might be a second. I need you here. You got this!
Fern:  You got this.

[Sweet P struggles against The Lich's voice in his head.]
The Lich:  [in Sweet P's voice] Quickly, while the boy is gone, we must seek out my well of power.
Sweet P:  [normal voice] No! Am I turning into a monster?
Fern:  That's the working theory.

[Finn pursues The Lich's hand through the woods.]
Jake's Voicemail:  I can't come to the phone right now. I'm either hanging with Finn, my kids, my G.F., or I'm dead. Bye!
[Tone beeps]
Finn:  Hey, man, hit me when you get this. [clicks tongue] Dude's missing a Lich fight. Okay, Lich. Get ready to die -- again -- for, like, the fifth time. Oh, hey, it's this awful place.
[Rustling]
Finn:  Oh, you're tricky, huh?
[Indistinct whispering]
Finn:  I can hear you down there!
[Whispering continues]
Finn:  Speak up, man. What?
[Rustling]
Finn:  Aah! Ooh! Aaaaaah!
The Lich:  [chuckles evilly] You bested me in many worlds, child, but I always return.
[Rock hisses]
Finn:  [grunts]
The Lich:  You're so evil, it's boring. You're basic, man.
Finn:  Yes. While a mortal world doubts and questions, I know exactly what I am. I am the ceaseless wheel, the last scholar of Golb. I am your doom.
Sweet P:  Skull man!
The Lich:  Huh?
Sweet P:  I, too, am doom.
Finn:  Hey, what's going on up there?
The Lich:  [laughs evilly] Child, you have failed. The vessel has turned. We reign now as twin kings of ruin.
Sweet P:  I'm not a king of ruin.
The Lich:  What?
Sweet P:  I am sweet. You're just a naughty hand.
The Lich:  Beast, obey me! Obey --
Sweet P:  No!
[Grunting]
[Slice]
Sweet P:  Eesh.
The Lich:  [groans]
[Spirits groan, scream]
Finn:  Hooray! You're a natural! But where's Fern?
Sweet P:  He wouldn't let me follow you, so I knocked him out cold.
Finn:  Yeah, I met my bio dad once, too. He wasn't evil incarnate, but he was kind of a crummy dude. T.T. and Mr. P. love you. That's all that matters.

[Later, Fern listens to a voicemail alone.]
Fern:  Fern, Sweet P saved me and slew The Lich! That's great.
Sweet P:  You're just a naughty hand.
The Lich:  Beast, obey me! Obey -- no!
Voicemail:  End of message. To repeat this message, press 7.
Finn:  What?
Voicemail:  To save...
Fern:  I don't get it. Why isn't it working out being myself? Finn's off having fun defeating losers. I can't even guard a baby. It doesn't matter how hard I try. I'll always just be in the shadow of the real Finn. Unless I could become... the only Finn.
Finn:  Uh, yeah, but that's a weird thing to call me.
