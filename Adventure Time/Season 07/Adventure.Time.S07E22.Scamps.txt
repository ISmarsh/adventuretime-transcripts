Finn:  ???:  Hmm. Hey, peebs, I think all these scamps need is a nature walk.

Princess Bubblegum:  ???:  Sounds good, finn. I trust you.

Scoffs:  ???:  How'd we do, boys?

Chuckles:  ???:  We made about 42 nuts.

Chuckles:  ???:  You lied to her.

Gary:  ???:  You're worse than us.

Scoffs:  ???:  No, you guys.He's better than us.

Category:  ???:  ‐huh?‐huh?

Together:  ???:  He just pulled one over on the princess.

???:  But he's a dope!

???:  Nah. Don't you get it? He's just pretending to be a dope, but deep down, he's a grifter like us.

???:  What?

Chuckles:  ???:  See? Look at him right now.

???:  He's all, "Who ‐‐ me?" Ha.

Together:  ???:  We could learn a lot from him. Teach us everything you know, Finn.

Gary:  ???:  I guess that works.

Finn:  ???:  We have to keep warm in the woods, so we're gonna build a fire. So, you take a minimum of two sticks, and you rub them together.

Category:  ???:  ‐huh?‐huh?

???:  Um, okay. You need to scam a couple of sticks. You can usually spot your average dimwitted sticks around these tree dummies. You trick them into a bundle like so. You grab two...marks and defraud them into rubbing together. You flim-flam your breath onto the sticks.

[ blowing ]

???:  You bamboozle these flaming idiot sticks onto the other marks and all of them will catch on fire...like a bunch of suckers.

???:  ‐whoa!‐whoa!

Finn:  ???:  These sticks are stone‐cold dopes.

[ laughter ]

[ thunder rumbles ]

Finn:  ???:  Looks like the clouds are gonna drop a dime on us. So I'll show youse guys how to build a shelter.

???:  ‐build?‐build?

???:  Yeah. You can always scam nature into being a shelter. You find a couple more branch rubes. You mislead the longest branch to lay horizontal between two blockhead trees. Then you double‐cross some leafy boughs into leaning against each other. Bam!You got a roof.

[ laughter ]

???:  You like how I did that? You got to be real conniving. Stick with me, boys. I'll teach you all the forest hustles.

Chuckles:  ???:  When you get hungry, you sneakup to a "Boosh," and wham! You hoax the berries.

Scoffs:  ???:  Heh! Food for nothing! These bushes are some easy marks, fellas.

Together:  ???:  Good thing we scammed a fire.

Finn:  ???:  Yeah.

Chuckles:  ???:  This open air would have hoodwinked our body temperature.

Scoffs:  ???:  Toss me someof those sweet bloobies, Gary.

Gary:  ???:  Hup![ sighs ]

???:  I got to geta picture of this. Wish I had a camera. I'll just tryto remember it good. And...perfect. Caramel quicksand! Mallow kids, help! I'm sinking!

Finn:  ???:  Say, what kind of scamis this?

Together:  ???:  Aah! It's no scam! I'm really sinking!

Gary:  ???:  Oh, wait. Do you want usto scam the quicksand?

Scoffs:  ???:  Throw me, uh ‐‐scam me a rope!

Chuckles:  ???:  You fellas see any fancy ropes around here?

Category:  ???:  Hey, you! Vine! Whoops. Hey,I barely touched him.

???:  Heck, I know i'd rather be a rope than a boring old vine.

Gary:  ???:  Yeah, you want to be a dumb plant your whole life?

Scoffs:  ???:  I'm sinking, dagnabit!

Chuckles:  ???:  How are we gonna scam this vine into being thrown over to Finn?

Gary:  ???:  Just yank it down!

[ bubbling ]

Chuckles:  ???:  Yank it down? What does that mean?

Gary:  ???:  Hey, fellas, you know what always works? Pea, pea. Where's the pea?

???:  Gee.

Finn:  ???:  I don't likethe looks of this.

Together:  ???:  We have to go old school.

???:  ‐no way, man.‐no way, man. We promised ourselves never to go old school unless things got serious.

Finn:  ???:  Things have gotten serious.

Gary:  ???:  Maybe this vine needs a sandwich packed with a slap!

Chuckles:  ???:  How does my slap sandwich taste?

Scoffs:  ???:  You're a rope from now on, see?

[ all grunting ]

???:  ‐you want some more?‐how does this feel?

Chuckles:  ???:  You need some more of this?

Scoffs:  ???:  [ plonk! ] aw, geez. We killed him.

[ gasps ]

???:  ‐yay!‐yay!

Together:  [ chanting ]Finn! Finn! Finn!

Finn:  ???:  Thanks, marshmallow kids.

Finn:  ???:  I thought I was going to sink forever.

???:  But we failed your test, Mr. Finn.We couldn't scam this guy into being a rope. We had to resort to low violence.

Together:  We ain't worthy to be your students.

Finn:  ???:  You can't use scams to save somebody from quicksand. You kids weren't scamming sticks or branches or anything. You've been camping the whole time.

Together:  ???:  Wow. You scammed us into thinking we were scamming. You scammed us good. You're our hero.

Finn:  ???:  Nothing was a scam.

Gary:  ???:  We're scamming this globe intoteaching us about geography.
