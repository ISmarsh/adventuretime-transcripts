[The episode begins with the original opening theme. The title card shown says "Adventure Time Presents: FINN & JAKE." Finn is seen riding on Jake as they are running through a cave made out of ice cream.]

Finn and Jake: Whoooooooooo-hoo!

[A group of ice cream monsters are chasing them]

Finn: Oh, man, are they angry!

Jake: Angry and fresh outta ice cream!

Finn: Heyoooo!

Jake: Up top. [climbs up to the ceiling]

Ice Cream Monsters: [growling]

Jake: Boiiii, this ice cream has so many flavors.

Finn: How many? 

Jake: Guess, bro.

Finn: Is it one? 

Jake: Nay.

Finn: Is it two? 

Jake: I say nay!

Finn: Is it...50?

Jake: I say yay! 50! 

Finn: [autotuned] 50!

Jake: This ice cream is so good, you have to sprinkle dirt in it just so your mind can handle it.

Finn: Come on, give it here. 

Jake: No, man! You can't just munch it down like any ol' snack. You gotta give it time.

Finn: Okay. Yeah. You can't rush things.

Jake: Exactly, dude. You can't rush -- Man, this tunnel is taking forever! [breaks through the wall] Duh!

Finn: Nice shortcut!

Ice King: [laughing]

Turtle Princess: Oh, dear.

Lumpy Space Princess: This sucks.

Finn: Ice King!

[Finn and Jake go after him]

Finn: [gasps]  Jake, the ice cream!

Jake: Huh? Oh, don't worry about it. This place is like a big freezer anyway.

[It begins to snow]

Jake: See? We got time.

Finn: [dodges a snowball] Aah! Snow Golem!

Snow Golem: [speaking gibberish]

Finn: Get wrecked!

[Snow golems resembling Peace Master and Uncle Gumbald appear]

Jake: More incoming!

Finn: Fling me, bro. Aaaaaaaaalgebraic! [The Peace Master Snow Golem is destroyed] Hyup! 

[The Gumbald snow golem picks Finn up, and starts to crush him]

Finn: [straining] Snow problem!

[Jake punches the golem's head, freeing Finn]

Finn: Ha ha, math.

Jake: Classic Finn.

[Cut to Ice King's castle]

Ice King: [laughing] Oh, I've done it now! Fate shall decree who shall be my bride!

[Turtle Princess and Lumpy Space Princess are tied to a giant, makeshift object resembling a weight scale.]

Ice King: It's like flipping a coin, but for intellectuals!

Finn: Ice King! 

Ice King: Huh?

[Finn kicks Ice King down]

Finn: Quit your creepings, old man. Or I will solve this situation with more violence!

Ice King: Ouch. Who will you save? The bright and fair turtle maiden? Or the mean, angry lump?

Lumpy Space Princess: I'm just authentic.

Ice King: Choose wisely, for when you save one, the other will fall straight into...a cauldron full of boiling ice! [laughing]

Turtle Princess: Oh, Finn! Please, save LSP!

Lumpy Space Princess: Gasp!

Turtle Princess: She's beautiful and smart. She's got so much to live for!

Lumpy Space Princess: Oh, my Glob! It's true! Save me, Finn!

Ice King: What a heroic dilemma!

Jake: What if we just save both?

Lumpy Space Princess: What? 

Finn: Oh, yeah.

Ice King: No fair!

Finn: [climbing up] Hep! Hop!

[As Jake goes to help him, he is partially frozen by Ice King]

Ice King: Schwa-za! 

Jake: Hnng!

Finn: Jake!

Jake: [giving a thumbs up] I'm alright, just save the Princesses!

Finn: Okay! Stay cool! Hah!

Lumpy Space Princess: I'm so bored.

Finn: Fear not, Highnesses.

Turtle Princess: You have soft hands. 

[The rope around Turtle Princess snaps, Finn catches her and throws her to safety]

Finn: Uh...shmow!

Turtle Princess: Aaaaaaaaaa-oof!

Lumpy Space Princess: Save me! Finn! 

Finn: LSP! [reaching out to her] Just...a little bit...closer.

Lumpy Space Princess: I...caaaaaan't.

[Ice King snaps the rope with a bolt of ice]

Lumpy Space Princess: Aaaaaaahhh! 

Finn: Aaahh! 

Jake: Aaahh!

Ice King: Aaahh! 

Lumpy Space Princess: [falling, slows down to a bounce and lands on Jake's head] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh! Aaaahhhh. Aaahhh. Ah. Oh, I'm so tired.

Jake: You did it, Finn! Everyone's alive!

Finn: Ha ha, yeah! [snowballs start flowing from his eyes] ...What? 

Turtle Princess: You guys! I just remembered! The library's being attacked by worms!

Finn: Oh, dang! Ice King! This is your chance for redemption. Come with us and freeze the worms!

Ice King: No thanks.

Lumpy Space Princess: Nah, don't even ask me to fight worms with you, Finn.

Finn: Jake, let's go!

Jake: Sorry, man. I gotta bail, too.

Finn: No, we're a team! [slamming the hilt of his sword on the block of ice with each word] You don't...break...up...the...team! [panting]

Jake: We'll meet up later and enjoy all of this sweet ice cream, alright?

Finn: Shut your dirty mouth!

[Finn heads toward the library, bringing Jake along in a wagon]

Jake: I'm just slowing you down!

[The giant worms are seen eating and tearing through the library]

Finn: Unhook those books! 

[Finn uses Jake's ice block and wagon as a weapon]

Jake: Yeowch! Oof! Hey!

Finn: [breathing heavily]

Jake: Heck yeah, dude! You did it!

Finn: We did it.

[They fist bump, and it hurts Jake a little]

Jake: Ouch.

Finn: [staring at his arm] Huh?

[One last worm emerges from the library, but is immediately grabbed by a giant bird]

Worm: Save me, Finn and Jake!

Finn: Hey! Swoop me, bird! I gotcha, Jake.

Jake: [sighs]

Finn: [gasps] Oh, cool! We're heading straight to the treehouse! What's that nest?

[Inside the nest, several skeletons are spread about]

Finn: Shlamowzow!

Jake: [shrugs] Eh, boids gotta eat.

Finn: Nuh-uh! [he bites the bird's foot, releasing them] Aah! Waaaaaaah! Oof. [gets up] Woo-hoo! It's ice cream time! Right, Jake?... [Jake strangely doesn't respond to him] Jake? [notices a dug up tombstone] What's that doing here? [Jake slowly crawls towards the grave] Wha...? What the heck, man?!

Jake: It's okay. This is where I'm supposed to be.

Finn: [tries to stop him] No! That is not what's supposed to be! We're s-- We're supposed to eat the 50-flavored ice cream. Together!

Jake: Bye, Finn.

[Jake melts into a liquid, spilling into the grave, horrifying Finn]

Finn: Wha-- Jake! [panting] Jaaaaaake! [as he freaks out, he sweats and his eyes swell up with tears, and an image of an elderly Finn is briefly flashed on-screen] No!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! This isn't happening! Not now! [he constantly slashes his hand through the water-filled grave] Not again! Not -- [Gasping, Finn looks up, but to his horror, the tombstone now reads R.I.P JAKE] Oh, Glob. Oh, Glob. Oh, Glob. Oh, Glob. Oh, Glob! No, no, no, no, no. [Finn rapidly sweats] Jake! Jaaaaaaakkee! [as he continues to freak out, another shot of an old Finn is briefly flashed on-screen] [panting; he takes off his shirt ] [cries, grunts] Jake. [his backpack suddenly starts to growl and move around like it's a sentient being] Aah! What the hey-hey? [He tugs on his backpack to get it off, and the world around him stretches as he tugs on his backpack] Get off me, you flippin' doof [suddenly, the environment fully changes to its true appearance, and we see the elderly current Finn, who is trying to get rid of a purple, four limbed creature off of his back] schmoof!

[grunts; he tosses the Dream Parasite off of his back, and squishes it]

Finn: Yuck. Man! Pretty convincing hallucination! I really thought I was young again. And that Jake was still alive. And we were bjorking it up like old times!

Goblin: Hello? Aah!  What the...? [the Dream Parasite latches onto him] Aahh. Welcome to my birthday party. We're gonna have so much fun.

Finn: Aha. The bugs are parasites. Resurfacing happy memories and eating the juicy mind Bobas. Well, I don't remember walking into this dungeon. 

[Finn puts his hand against a black wall, from which an old lady slowly emerges]

Finn: So either there's some kind of...

Old Lady: [A dream parasite climbs on her] Aah!

Finn: [takes it off]...memory wipe thing...or I'm really getting old. [kicks another parasite off] I'll get y'all out of this weird dungeon. Grab that guy. Look! A way out. [grunting, panting]

[They all run down a broken escalator, where Finn sees the Gate Guardian land from above]

Gate Guardian: Oh, sorry, newbies. I was on a bathroom break. [clears throat] Welcome to eternity.

Finn: Huh?

[Several skeletons rise, waving their arms]

Finn: Oh.

[The title card appears again, revealing the rest of the title: "FINN & JAKE ARE DEAD."]

Finn: I'm dead. [sighs] I finally bit the dust. Cashed in my chips. Bought the farm. That means...I get to see Jake again! Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

Gate Guardian: [blocks Finn with his hand] Cause of death?

Finn: [climbing over his hand] Who gives a toot?

Gate Guardian: Hey! [fails to grab Finn] Hot dog it! [pointing] The rest of y'all better stay in line!

Finn: Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake! [gasps] Jake! You waited for me! [progressively becoming younger] I'm here! Your baby bro-bro, man! Your best boi!

Mr. Fox: Finn, my man. Congrats on dying.

Finn: Mr. Fox? I...I-I wasn't expecting you.

Mr. Fox: No?  I've been expecting you, though. I'm your officially assigned guide to the dead worlds. [pointing to his badge] "Dead, question mark? Ask me!"

Finn: Can you take me to Jake?

Mr. Fox: No. 

Finn: [hastily] Okay, catch you later, bye.

Mr. Fox: I'm only a low-level clerk guy workin' slow and steady toward my ultimate goal --a hypoallergenic pillow. 

Finn: What? That's -- That's really all you want?

Mr. Fox: There are a lot of dust mites around here. Apparently dust mites have souls and dies. Which I did not know about.

Finn: [clapping]

Mr. Fox: Thank you, thank you.

Finn: Hey, I remember a lot more skeletons the last time I was here. 

Mr. Fox: That's all projection and perception. You're doing it right now. Look at that young meat.

Finn: Whoa! You're right! I'm toight.

Mr. Fox: You can look like any past version of yourself in the dead worlds. [his head splits in half, revealing his skull]

Finn: Jeepers! 

Mr. Fox: Yes. It's disgusting.

Finn: [becoming Shoko] It's...awesome.

Mr. Fox: Cool look.

Shoko: Hmm.

[Finn transforms into the interdimensional creature]

Mr. Fox: What is that?

[Finn transforms into his butterfly form]

Mr. Fox: Beautiful.

[Finn transforms into a smaller version of his Catalyst Comet form]

Mr. Fox: Whoa!

[Finn becomes an infant]

Mr. Fox: Cute. 

Finn: [donning his original look] Now I'm done.

Mr. Fox: This is what you're going with, huh?

Finn: Yeah. It's recognizable.

Mr. Fox: So, the rules around here are simple. Or they used to be. I'm not sure with this new regime.

Finn: [clapping]

Mr. Fox: Anyway, your spiritual style and past life quotient usually det--What are you doing?

Finn: It's a signal Jake came up with so we could find each other if we got separated in death.

Mr. Fox: Oh. Look, Finn --

Finn: Shh. We gotta find Jake so we can be reborn together. [clapping]

Mr. Fox: That's...not gonna work. Jake's not here.

Finn: [gasps, continues clapping] Jake has to be here!

Mr. Fox: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I just meant he's not here here. He's defs somewhere in the dead worlds.

Finn: [shaking him] Where?! 

Mr. Fox: Waahhh! I don't know. But, like, everyone else is here. Friends, enemies...well, not everyone. You know Boobafina was reincarnated as a tugboat? Good for her, right? [reading ticket] Looks like you've been assigned to...Oh! The 37th dead world.

[An undertaker appears, rips the ticket, hands Mr. Fox a new one, and disappears]

Mr. Fox: Well, scratch that. Looks like you've been reassigned.

Finn: Who the heck was that? Can they take me to Jake?

Mr. Fox: Undertakers travel between dead worlds, but it's gotta be approved by the new boss. Oops. New Death.

Finn: New Death? Then let's go to New Death's castle!

Mr. Fox: No, wait! Finn!

Finn: [panting] New Death! Let me in!

Mr. Fox: Shh, shh!

Finn: I wanna see death! [loud, echoed] Now! [is knocked to the ground] Oof!

Undertaker #1: No normies allowed in the castle, bro.

Undertaker #2: Beat it, or we'll turn your insides into bath bombs.

Finn: Oh, yeah?! Well, I've got a shiny new bod to kick your butts with!

Tiffany: Stop! This one's mine.

Finn: [thinking] Is that guy gonna stab me?

[The masked Tiffany puts Finn's head against his]

Finn: Huh?

[Tiffany reveals himself]

Finn: [in a mix of emotions] Tiffany?!

Tiffany: Surprised to see me, Finn? And yet, how could you be, locked forever as we are in unbreakable chains of mutual hatred and respect.

Finn: You're a cop now.

Tiffany: Yeah, a cool cop. I'll take you where you need to go.

Mr. Fox: I can't believe we're actually inside.

Tiffany: Yeah, undertakers get crazy good perks.

Finn: Oh! Can you take me to Jake?

Tiffany: [sighs] Jake...no. Jake's in the highest of the high places, the elitest fields. He's in...the 50th dead world.

Finn: [astonished] The 50th dead world.

Mr. Fox: You know, this place looks way different than I pictured. Like, weird dude vibes.

[Finn touches a giant green plant, one of its faces giggles]

Tiffany: Hey! Don't touch anything!

Finn: Dude, when did you become such a rules guy?

Tiffany: Since I got a swole boss. New Death has a visionary plan for the dead worlds, and I'm gonna be first in line for the buffet of destiny.

Finn: What's that mean?

Tiffany: Stay away from this bottomless void! It's bottomless, which is cool.

Mr. Fox: That is cool.

Finn: What's up there? 

Tiffany: That's nothing. Just Death's throne room.

Finn: What?! I thought that's where you were taking me!

Tiffany: Nah, I was taking you to my studio apartment to hang. Nobody sees Death! The most you can hope for is a two-legged stool, like a blan-- [Finn knocks him out cold with a rock]

Mr. Fox: Oh, geez!

Finn: I'm talkin' to Death!

Mr. Fox: Slow down.

[Death metal music playing]

Finn: Death!

New Death: [swinging his scythe] Whoa! Hyah! Yeah-ha! [pops a soda can open with his tooth, laughing; muttering] Thank you for all the strength that you give me. Thank you for being my best friend in the entire world. [kisses his hand]

Finn: [turns the music off] Uh, Mr.  Death?

New Death: Huh? How'd you get in here?!

Mr: Fox: Quick brown fox! [jumps off of Tiffany]

Tiffany: Oof!

New Death: Way to guard the castle, Mullet! [throws his soda can]

Tiffany: Ack!

New Death: [sighs]

Undertaker: I'm sure you'll hit him next throw, sir.

New Death: I missed on purpose! [breathes fire on the undertaker, disintegrating him]

Finn: Dang, dude.

Tiffany: I'm sorry, bro. I don't know how they got in! 

New Death: Cram it, dirt-stache! You're making me hecka aggro! [about to swing his scythe] Here comes the boom!

Finn: New Death, please! I have to find my brother Jake! He's in the 50th dead world.

New Death: The fi--Oh, come on. The 50th?

Finn: You gotta help me out. I'm buds with Old Death! We hung out that one time.

New Death: Oh, that clown? That guy sucked.

[New Death grimaces at an old zen rake. A flashback begins. The original Death is seen raking sand. His son, pre-New Death, approaches him.]

New Death: Ugh. Alright. I'm here. What do you want?

[Death gestures to a zen rake]

New Death: Oh no, not this crud again. Ugh. My friend's waiting for me.

[When he tries to leave, Death reappears at the exit and hands him the rake.]

New Death: Ugh! Freakin' zen rake. [becoming impatient, aggressively swiping at the sand] I don't care if you hate my new friend! He's cool! He's got a cool vibe! What have you ever done for me, huh?! Made me scrape stupid shapes in your stupid sand. Why aren't you answering me?!

[He attempts to strike his father with the rake, Death grips it and holds him back. The flashback ends as father and son make eye contact.] 

New Death: I'm doing my own thing. Getting rid of all these pointless dead worlds, butt-droppin' souls, breaking the wheel of rein-- reincarnation. It's gonna be sick.

Finn: That's bunk! Eat dead feeeeeet! [He leaps to kick New Death, but phases right through him] Ugh!

New Death: [holding his scythe at Finn's neck] So, cheeseball, any last words before I smash your atoms to oblivion?

Finn: I'm gonna find Jake. I'll get to the 50th dead world no matter what!

New Death: [smiling evilly] Hmm.

Finn: What?

New Death: Pfft. Get this loser out of here.

Finn: But...? [gets thrown out] Oof!

Mr. Fox: I thought you were double-dead for sure!

Tiffany: Well, now you've done it, Finn. We're blood enemies again! I'm gonna go eat my feelings in the pizza dead world. [inhales as he is about to blow his undertaker pipe]

Finn: I'm sorry. I just...I really miss Jake, you know. You of all people must understand that. Don't you?

Tiffany: Yes. I do understand. [hugs Finn]

Finn: Then you understand why I have to do this! [shoves Tiffany and steals his pipe]

Tiffany: Ohh!

Finn: [plays note] Sorry again!

Mr. Fox: Guess I'm not getting that pillow now.

[Finn enters the 30th dead world]

Finn: Jake? Jake! This dead world's like a grandma calendar.

[Tree Trunks is seen on a swing, laughing]

Finn: Tree Trunks!

Tree Trunks: Howdy, Finn!

Finn: I missed you, Tree Trunks! Is Jake here? What dead world is this?

Mr. Pig: Dead world 30. Where life is purdy. No Jake, though.

Finn: Dang. I guess I'll try all of these...holes. [plays note]

[Finn enters a music themed dead world, with discordant music playing]

Finn: Jake? [plays note]

[Finn enters a dead world with strange creatures going into a large monster's mouth]

Finn: So y'all are...eating each other. Okay. Jake?! [plays note]

[Finn enters a dead world filled with bird-like statues and white rivers]

Finn: Jake! [drinks the river's liquid] Mmm! [plays note]

[Finn enters the 1st dead world]

Finn: Jaaaaake! Ugh. Dang, this place is stanky! None of the other ones is this bad. Anybody here? What dead world this?

Choose Goose: You've reached dead world the first. Number one in being worst.

Finn: Choose Goose! You're here?

Choose Goose: I know! It's weird! Rhymes aren't crimes!

Finn: Yikes. Uh...I'll save you, Choogles.

1st Dead World souls: Oh. Great. Oh, this is good. Look at that. [they start to surround Finn]

Finn: [grunting] 

Choose Goose: Finn, stay back! These souls are wack! 

Finn: Aah!

1st Dead World souls: Save us! Save us!

[Finn blows the pipe again to escape]

Tiffany: Please, boss! Gimme a second chance!

New Death: Man, I should obliterate you into silently screaming quarks!

Tiffany: Please, I-I'll do anything!

New Death: Alright, Tiff.

Tiffany: Wha--?

New Death: If you're my dawg, you gotta bark with me. Grab a couple of wing-boys and head to the 45th dead world. Jack that place up.

[Cut back to Finn]

Finn: Jake? Jake? Is this the 50th?

Three-eyed, bird-like creature: Wa wa, wa wa wa!

Finn: [angrily] I've played every note on this stupid pipe!

Joshua: Nix the waterworks, sonny. Bellyachin' never solved a ding dang thing! Nyah.

Margaret: Welcome home.

Finn: Mom? Dad? Mom! [hugs them]

Joshua: It's good to see you again, you big crybaby.

Finn: I crazy missed you two!

Margaret: Come, come! I made you some treats.

Finn: Finn cakes?

Margaret: No, no. Weaponry. The dead worlds are a real rat's nest these days. Here's some paper talismans for spiritual warfare.

Finn: Hold on, do you know how to get to the 50th dead world? I've tried everything.

Margaret: Well, dearie, in order to get there, you have to...Hmm. You have to not want to get there.

Joshua: It's zen or something.

Finn: Not want to get there. Okay! Yeah! I'm gonna not wanna do that so hard! [grunting] Hmmmmmmmm.

Joshua: Finn! 

Finn: Come on! Don't you wanna reach the 50th, too?

Margaret: Oh. Oh, no, this place is the berries.

Joshua: Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.

Finn: Ah! I'm not giving up! [goes up to the roof]

Jermaine: Surprise, little brother! I'm here, too! Oh, he's gone.

Finn: I don't wanna get to the 50th dead world. I don't wanna see Jake's adorable face. I don't miss you at all, my beautiful, perfect Jake!

[Thumping is heard at the door]

Margaret: Get my axe. [opens the door] Now, what's all this racket about?

[Tiffany appears, Joshua and Margaret gasp as the undertakers are about to destroy the dead world]

Tiffany: Sorry.

Joshua: What the dickens?

Joshua and Margaret: Holy sm-o-o-o-okes!

Finn: [gasps, notices the dead world is in ruin] Aah! Mom! Dad! [gasps] Mom! Dad! [kneels down] What's the point? [crying] Jake... [sniffling] ... [angered; tears rapidly run down his face] why didn't you wait for me? [he rapidly ages back into his elderly form] J-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ake! [his flesh rips off, revealing his skeleton] I need you. [a portal in the sky suddenly opens] What the... [out of it comes Jake, now wearing a white robe. Finn gasps, causing his flesh to return. Laughing, he happily makes a leap of faith towards his incoming old friend] Jake! Jake! [Laughs] Jake! Jake. [he hugs his friend as tight as he can & his eyes swell with tears of joy, finally reunited with his best friend] Jake. You found me.

Jake: Yeah...Who's Jake? 

[Finn sniffs in great victory]

Finn: Lemme scope that golden mug.

Jake: Do I know you?

Finn: Yes, you know me! It's Finn! Finn!

Jake: Right, right. I'm just messin' with you, Fern.

Finn: Are you still messin' with me? [sobs]

Jake: Yeah, brother. You're Finn. I know you.

Finn: Pretty funny, dude. Ha ha. 

Jake: I was hanging out in Nirvana beyond all desire when I picked up your vibe. It was so bananas intense that I had to check it out.

Finn: [sniffles] Thank you.

Jake: But...I can see you're doing just fine. I'll see you when you get to the 50th.

Finn: Wait! I'm not doing fine, you ding dong! We were supposed to be dead...together. And then get reborn...together. Lil' bro bros forever. [blows his nose on Jake's robe]

Jake: Huh. Well...[he begins to float back up to the portal, Finn holds him back]

Finn: Dude, why don't you care?!

Jake: Wish I could help, but I've moved beyond all this stuff.

Finn: Uh...Oh! Look what I have! Gum!

Jake: [floats back down] This used to be my jam. [chewing] Mmm. Mm!

Finn: I made sure I was buried with it. [an undertaker grabs him from behind] Aah!

[Two other undertakers crash into the platform]

Finn: Look out!

Undertaker #1: Bro, wedge that dog in the gold hole!

Finn: Jake! Wah!

Undertaker #2: [is kicked in the face] My bone mask!

Undertaker #1: Get lost, gramps!

Finn: Bite me, you bunch of dag gone spare ribs!

[He fights them, but is clearly outnumbered, constantly suffering several injuries]

Finn: What time is it? Oof!

Undertaker #3: Bam!

Finn: [weakly] Jake...

Jake: Hmm? [he raises a fist, his knuckles cracking]

Undertaker #3: [he chuckles, Jake throws his gum on him] That's gross, man.

Jake: Lay...off...my...boy! [he jumps out of his robe and takes out the undertakers in three punches] That felt really good!

New Death: [appears, laughing] Yes!

Tiffany: Jake!

New Death: [laughing] No matter how hard I raged, that dead world refused to open for me.

Finn: Cause it's no jerks allowed!

New Death: Stuff it! I knew you'd do anything to get your dumb friend back. So I just waited until you dragged him out of there, and I could get in. [blinks in unison with the eye on the pipe] You selfish tool.

Finn: No.

Jake: I really don't like this guy.

Finn: He played me like a straight-up didgeridoo!

Jake: I'm gonna sic 'em up. Bark! 

Finn: Uh, Jake...

[Jake charges at New Death, but goes right through him]

Jake: Rah! Whooaa!

Finn: Ah! [he grabs Jake's hand] Gotcha!

[New Death enters the 50th dead world, with Tiffany, Finn, and Jake following]

Jake: Hup. [straining] Ooh!

New Death: What...a...rip-off! I hard-core schemed my way into a hippie choir?!

Jake: 50's not just a place. It's a state of mind.

[A marshmallow kid takes the form of an enlightened soul]

New Death: That's the dumbest--That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Hey! I rule you! [punches Booshy]

Finn: Yo, don't push Booshy! 

Jake: Chill.

New Death: Don't tell me what to do! Y'all gotta pass my judgment now! And I say...everybody out! [he rips a circular platform around himself, making the rest of the world and its inhabitants fall]

New Death: [laughing] What's up!

[Falling, Finn and Jake parachute into the 1st dead world, now infested with monsters]

Finn: Back in the mud. 

Wyatt: Oohh. When will my misery end? [his nose is pinched by a lobster monster] Aah! Mr. Eel, pity me! [electricity crackles] Aaah!

[The animals from the 30th dead world fall in, exclaiming]

Finn and Jake: Tree Trunks!

Wyatt: Well, well.

Tree Trunks: [crying] Wyatt?

Wyatt: Look who came crawling back.

Tree Trunks: [whines]

Finn: This is all my fault. I'm just another easy-to-scam old guy.

Jake: Hey! We're Finn and Jake! We'll fix this! [he stretches into a giant platform] Choo-choo! Climb aboard, doomed souls!

Mr. Pig: Oh! It's Jacob the dog!

[indistinct conversations]

Jake: Eh, just gotta do this for...forever, I guess.

Tiffany: Oh, to wrestle with the unforgiving boundaries of moral judgment whilst influenced by the illusion of free will. I'm but a weed! Can you see me?

[Joshua and Margaret are shown to be tied up]

Margaret: Alls I see is a half-portion crumb giving us the run-around!

Joshua: Weren't you supposed to dump us into DW number one?

Tiffany: Don't question my mercy, Hat Jake! Just eat your cake. You too, Lady Jake.

Joshua: Do as he says, Margaret. Mmm! 

Margaret: Mmm! Well, you're a very odd duck, but you bake a swell cake.

Tiffany: [sighs] If only Jake could see me feeding all of his beloved Jakes.

Jermaine: Hey, Mr. Oiler? Can you take a look at your portrait? Hope you don't have any notes, I already started the shading.

[Jermaine has painted a family portrait]

Tiffany: [notices his scowl in the portrait] Worst Jake, why this face?

Jermaine: 'Cause that's what you look like. Constantly.

Tiffany: Ugh! This is all Finn's fault! I was at peace with never seeing Jake again, but then that macaroon sapling came along and pulled the veil on my empty existence! It ends.

Joshua: Hey, now! 

Margaret: Park that keister!

Tiffany: I know what I gotta do.

[Finn struggles to reach out to Ghost Princess and Clarence, who are sinking in the mud]

Finn: Come on, guys, work with me!

Jake: Don't worry. They're fine.

Finn: I guess they do look at peace. I really messed up. My fool butt led New Death into the 50th dead world, I blew up mom and dad. I ruined your chance for happiness. Because I'm a selfish fool man.

Jake: I woulda been the fool man if I'd stayed all zoned out when there's a butt of injustice to kick.

[The residents of the 30th dead world are stacked upon each other, trying to reach Jake]

Mr. Pig: Whoaa! Whoooooaa!

Wyatt: I'll show you chumps how m'lady likes to be hoisted. [he starts climbing up the stack, making them all lose balance] Aaahh!

Finn: Look at these poor suckers. [an eel lunges at him] Oh, Glob! 

Jake: Finn! [grabs and throws the eel away]

Wyatt: [offscreen] No, Mr. Eel!

Finn: [holding his hands to his head] We're stuck here forever and there's no one in the dead worlds that can help us.

Jake: Should we contact someone outside the dead worlds?

Finn: You can do that?! 

Jake: Yeah.

Finn: Well, what the heck, Jake, why didn't you call me?!

Jake: I dunno, I thought it might've been creepy.

Finn: Well, if I had died first, I would've had the courtesy to ghost-call you all the dang time!

Jake: Well, la-dee-da! Mr. Courtesy over here.

Finn: Hmph!

Jake: Who should we call? 

Finn: Hmm...Oh, PB!

Finn and Jake: [holding both hands] Princess, Princess, Princess, Princess, Princess, Princess.

[The Candy Kingdom comes into view, having changed to a "magical" appearance. A statue of Princess Bubblegum is seen inside, and Peppermint Butler is polishing it.]

Peppermint Butler: [humming] Aah! [speaking gibberish] Kee Oth Rama Pancake. [said backwards] Something is attempting contact. [reading the message spelled on a Ouija board] "B"..."U"..."T"..."T." [gasps] A soul in distress! Come forth, oh, honorable spirit! Come forth!

[Finn and Jake's spirits appear]

Jake: Oh, hey, Pep Butt.

Finn: You look good.

Peppermint Butler: Thanks, Finn. So what can I do for you guys?

Finn: Death's been replaced...by New Death!

Jake: And he's pbht!

Finn: He's immoral! He's -- He's a tyrant!

Peppermint Butler: [sucks through teeth] I'm afraid I can't help with that. I know someone who can, though.

Finn: Oh, cool! 

Peppermint Butler: But! A favor for a favor. All I ask is for permission to use your bones...for a spell.

Finn: What kind of spell?

Peppermint Butler: Bone spell.

Finn: Alright, I guess. [shrugging] I dunno where they are, though, so you'll have to --

Peppermint Butler: Oh, I already have them.

Finn: Hey!

Peppermint Butler: You must travel to the underwater gardens where the goddess Life dwells.

Finn and Jake: Life?

Peppermint Butler: As long as the candle burns, you will stay in Life's realm.

Finn: It's almost all gone as it is.

Peppermint Butler: Yes. 

Finn: Hmm. We'll make this quick then.

[Life's realm is seen, thriving with aquatic life. Finn and Jake's souls then enter two fish.]

Finn: Guess we're nasty fish for now.

Jake: Just gotta have good body image. [he shapeshifts into a muscular merman] Whoop!

Finn: I love it.

[The volcano rumbles and a soul emerges from it, and it goes down to where Life is seen]

Soul: Wah! Oh, geez. I'm really doing this. Aah!  Oof!

Life: Ahh. Are you ready, little soul? [starts molding the soul's new form]

Soul: Please let me be something cool this time.

Life: [humming]

Soul: [is molded into a beetle] Oh. That's what I get for hoping.

Life: [sends the soul off] Enjoy my gift, little one.

Soul: I won't!

Life: I know you're there...Finn and Jake.

Finn: Sorry, Life, ma'am! Didn't mean to creep. [clears throat] We doth require thine aid. New Death rules the dead worlds with a giant idiot fist!

Jake: He's a massive cheese toot! 

Finn: Yeah. It's like his dad was an idiot fist.

Jake: And his mom is a big, smelly cheese toot.

[The two laugh]

Life: He's my son.

[They awkwardly stammer]

Jake: Ehh, maybe he's just nervous at work!

Life: He's always been difficult to deal with, but the dead worlds are his charge now.

Finn: But he's your son!

Jake: Yeah, ma'am. Get in his business!

Life: The transmigration of souls is my business. [a pair of souls appear] Ooh, these two are a package deal. [she molds them into a carrot and a pea] So cute! I've learned to draw joy from my work instead of my family. [as she is about to send the souls off, the light from the reincarnation portal disappears, and the volcano stops smoking] What?

Finn: Life...your large son is cutting off reincarnation altogether.

Life: [gasping, she accidentally drops the two souls. She gains several hissing snake heads and arms, as she fumes with rage] He...did...what?!

Finn and Jake: Eeesh. 

Life: He's just going to snatch my entire purpose from me?! [She angrily speaks to herself in French as she rips off a tree branch for a staff, and molds a snake around it] Après tout ce que j'ai fait pour ce garçon! Après tout ce que j'ai fait pour lui! Non mais c'est pas possible! Ce n'est pas possible! Ça me... Ça me met en furie complètement! C'est pas possible! ["After everything I did for this boy! After everything I did for him! No, that's unbelievable! That's unbelievable! It's... It's making me completely furious! That's unbelievable!"] [She sighs, the snakes retracting, and kisses the staff.] That is the kiss of life. It has the power to conquer death. But beware. It comes with a very important warning.

[The fish return to normal, as Finn and Jake ran out of time]

Life: Shoot.

[Finn and Jake reappear in the 1st dead world, falling]

Jake: Waaaaaaaaaaa! 

Finn: Ohhhhh!

Jake: [blubbering] Phooey! Is the swirly-bob okay?

Finn: [studying the kiss of life] Hmmm. What do you think Life was trying to warn us about?

[Tiffany appears, and a giant, scaled monster emerges. He slays it just before it reaches Finn.]

Finn: Tiffany! You saved me!

Tiffany: Don't flatter yourself. I'm here for Jake. Now I can be happy at long last!

Jake: Nah, take a look around you. No souls are ever gonna be happy. Not as long as new dope's in charge.

Finn: We're gonna take him down!

Tiffany: Uhhh. Yeah! Anarchy! I'll help you sneak into his castle. And also let's rob him!

Finn: I don't trust him. Sounds sordid.

Jake: We "sordon't" have a choice.

Tiffany: No choice! No choice! No choice! [peering at the castle's entrance] Hmm. You'll get pinched for sure looking like that. Disguise yourselves.

[Finn and Jake give a thumbs up]

Undertakers: [laughter]

[Tiffany enters, with Finn and Jake disguised as Shoko and her tiger.]

Shoko: 'Sup, U.T. Gang? I'm a mysterious newcomer looking to make my bones!

Jake: [straining]

Undertaker #1: Yo, what's with the chubby tiger?

Tiffany: Just -- Just a couple of new recruits. [he slaps Jake on the side with his wing]

Jake: [straining, farts]

Finn: [bursts into laughter, revealing himself]

Jake: [sighs in relief, undoing his disguise as well]

Undertaker #2: It's Finn and Jake!

Finn: My name's Shoko. [Tiffany grabs him]

Tiffany: This way!

Undertaker: Over there! 

Tiffany: Quick! This chute leads directly to the observatory. [Finn and Jake enter the chute] Go on! 

Undertaker: They couldn't have gotten far. 

Tiffany: Hey, plebs! Bite my wings. Tiffany!

[Other undertakers are blowing up the remaining dead worlds, as New Death watches them fade to black]

Mr. Fox: How's the demolition coming along, sir?

New Death: Stupid dead worlds are all goin' up in smoke! [he chugs a soda can]

Mr. Fox: [chuckles] Hey, that's great. Really looking forward to things being terrible forever.

New Death: [he finishes drinking the can, crushes it and tosses it] Go get me another case, loser!

Mr. Fox: Yessir, yessir!

Finn: Yo, snake boy!

New Death: [turns around] Hmm? 

Jake: This is it, Death!

Finn: We've got a magic stick, and we're gonna kick your butt!

New Death: [raising his scythe, laughing] Come on! I'm all jacked upon destruction!

Finn: Imma jack you up, jabroni!

New Death: Ha, no weapons can touch -- [Finn swings the staff, knocking him down] Ow. [groaning]

Finn: I thought he would, like, blow up or something.

Jake: Hey, let me try!

Finn: [tosses the staff to Jake] Tag!

New Death: Ow! Quit it! Ow!

Jake: [throws it back to Finn] Oops, dropped it.

[Finn and Jake continue taking turns attacking New Death with the kiss of life]

New Death: [swings his scythe, but misses] Yeah! Oof. Ugh!

[Tiffany is still running from the other Undertakers, but trips on a branch]

Undertaker #1: Gotcha.

Tiffany: Glob you! [the undertakers defeat him with ease] Oof! Uhh! [groans] Aaaaaahhhh!

[They laugh as they bring Tiffany to the bottomless pit]

Undertaker #2: Feels bad getting pushed around, huh?

Tiffany: Wahh! Huh? [his wings are ripped off]

Undertakers: [cover their eyes] Ugh.

Tiffany: You better spend the rest of your afterlife looking over your should-- [is dropped; thinking] Is this the final death of Tiffany?

[Joshua and Margaret catch him with a net]

Joshua: Gotcha!

Tiffany: But...I tied you up!

Joshua: Boy, your knots are terrible. [the knot easily comes undone] You need a father figure to teach you proper ropework.

Tiffany: "Father"? 

Joshua: [bringing him in] Nice and easy.

Tiffany: [shrinks down to an infant-like form] Do you really mean all that stuff you just said?About...teaching me...and...

Margaret: [knocks an undertaker into the pit] Hiyah! 

Undertaker: Aahhh!

Margaret: Less bonding, more bonking!

Undertaker: Not the pit! 

Margaret: Behind you, son!

Tiffany: "Son"?

Joshua: [smacks another undertaker] Nyah!

New Death: [is knocked to the ground] Ugh!

[Finn in the Jake Suit is wielding the kiss of life, and he exits it, panting]

Finn: The kiss ain't working!

Jake: Maybe we're doing it wrong. [kisses the staff] My kisses are legendary and this stick ain't vibing with me at all.

Finn: Lemme try. [smooches] Nope. What if we both kiss it?

Jake: Like at the same time?

Finn: Yeah! It'll be like...a kiss combo!

Jake: Alright.

New Death: [gaining speed] Mmmmm...

Finn: He's charging!

Jake: [rummaging through Finn's backpack] You got any bombs or something in here?

New Death: I'm gonna kill you! [Finn attaches Margaret's "Hold Still" note to him, rendering him immobile, he struggles] What's this?

Jake: That's a note from our mom.

Finn: Look, you can stay like this forever or you can fix the dead worlds.

New Death: Ugh! I didn't even want this stupid job!

Finn: Wait. What does that mean?

[The flashback from earlier continues. New Death is still attempting to strike his father with the rake, while Death easily holds him back.]

New Death: Think I can't take you, Dad?

[Death disarms his son, and embraces him.]

New Death: Wha...? Aah! Aaaahhh! [grunting]

The Lich: [distant] Strike...

New Death: Huh?

The Lich: Strike now.

New Death: Huh? 

The Lich: Strike now!

New Death: Gaaahhh! [bites Death]

Jake: [interrupting] You bit your dad?

New Death: Yeah, I bit him! Shut up!

[Return to flashback]

New Death: I showed him, huh?

[Death maintains a shocked expression as his hat fades away. He then transforms into the strange, large plant seen earlier.]

New Death: What did I do? Mom's gonna kill me! Ack!

[His head becomes skeletal, and his arms burst into snakes that entwine, becoming his "chains"] Aaahh! Best friend...help me!

New Death: I didn't realize that when I took out Death, I'd be chained to all his stuff. So how 'bout it? You ready to get chained to my stuff?

Jake: What do we do?

Finn: Leave him like this.

[New Death cackles, and his laughter transitions to the Lich's]

The Lich: Burn. Heroes of Ooo, it's only a matter of time.

Finn: I know that voice. [takes off New Death's glove] Yoink!

The Lich: Finally dead, aren't you, child?

Finn: The Lich. [inhales deeply] Not before you. I slayed you a bunch of times.

[A series of Lich-related events are shown. His first appearance, when he possessed Princess Bubblegum, the snail, and Billy, when he was transformed by the Citadel Guardian blood, the encounter in Farmworld, and when his disembodied hand was slain.]

Jake: You've been puppeting New Death this whole time!

The Lich: The spawn of life and death is a creature without purpose, fit only to be a pawn in my eternal quest to end all life.

Finn: Just let it go, man!

The Lich: With this vessel, my victory is inevitable. [murmuring an incantation, the note starts to burn]

Jake: That settles it.

Finn: We have to ice Death now. And we both know who needs to -- [Jake shoves him] Oof!

Jake: Like you're gonna go around harvesting the souls of cute widdle bunnies? Leave it to your big bro.

Finn: Old man Finn was a bunny slayer.

Jake: You don't got the boingloings! [kicks Finn in the crotch]

Finn: [pained] No!

Jake: Sorry, Finn. Death me! 

Finn: [tackles Jake] Gimme the stick! [pounds his head]

Jake: Oof! 

Finn: I save you! Whoa!

[Jake lunges at him as Shoko's tiger and in his shapeshifter form, Finn evades as Shoko]

Jake: [increasing in size] Rah! I...save...you!

[Jake slams Finn to the ground, Finn briefly turns into Lumpy Finn to escape]

Jake: You've got so many lives ahead of you!

Finn: Well, I don't want 'em! Not if you won't be there with me! [bites Jake]

Jake: Yowch! [stretches upward and bashes Finn through the ceiling]

Mr. Fox: So sorry about the delay. [he sees the destruction caused] Aaah!

Finn: [crying] I love you.

Jake: [crying] I love you, too!

Mr. Fox: You're fighting over...a stick? You're brothers! You're a team! Agh!

[The Lich-possessed New Death laughs as he has now completely burned the talisman note, and begins to charge again. Mr. Fox activates the Kiss of Life, the snake comes to life and it quickly leaps to bite New Death.]

New Death: [short, weak gasping] Mom?

[New Death explodes into tumbleweeds and Lich essence. All that remains is the Lich's hand.]

Finn: Oh. We were holding the kiss of life by the wrong...end.

Finn and Jake: Mr. Fox!

[Mr. Fox, being the one who defeated New Death, is now the current Death.]

Mr. Fox: Oh, hey. How 'bout that?

The Lich: Yes. You've taken the crown, but without a strong right hand --

Jake: [stomps on the hand, and throws him] Get outta here! 

The Lich: Noooo!

Mr. Fox: [picks up New Death's scythe] Hmm. [turns it into a pillow and hugs it]

[The monsters in the 1st Dead World disappear. All the souls return to their proper dead worlds, excluding Wyatt, already where he belongs.]

Wyatt: Wow, look at everyone go...without Wyatt.

[The lights for the Dead Worlds reactivate, showing they have been restored.]

Jake: Just like unflushing a toilet.

Joshua: Finn! Jake!

Margaret: We're here, boys!

Jermaine: [panting] We're here.

Jake: Mom! Dad!

Finn: Tiffany? 

Joshua: That's right. We're gonna help our new son get on the right track!

Tiffany: Now I'm their favorite!

Margaret: Tsk, tsk, tsk.

[Joshua, Margaret, Jermaine, and Tiffany are back in the 45th Dead World, waving to Finn and Jake.]

Mr. Fox: So, Finn...ready to settle into the 37th?

Finn: Yeah...about that. Jake...when you left, I kind of freaked out. It was the worst thing to ever happen to me.

Jake: Aw, come on. You still had plenty of other things to live for, right?

Finn: Yeah. But deep down, I just kept waiting for the day I'd finally see you again.

Jake: Aww.

Finn: [inhales deeply] Mr. Death? I wanna go back.

[Mr. Fox nods, snaps his fingers, and opens a portal]

Jake: I'm proud of you, bro.

Finn: Thanks, bro.

Jake: You'll be ready for the 50th before you know it. Go back there and live that best life. 

[Finn enters the portal. Before reentering the 50th dead world, Jake changes his mind and rushes after Finn.]

Jake: [straining] Doh! Oof! 

Mr. Fox: No, wait! Eh, I'm not your mom.

Finn: Wonder what life's gonna turn me into this time. [Jake grabs his arm] Jake?! What are you doing?! I just had my donkin' epiphany!

Jake: I know. I'm just coming back for fun. Because it's great being alive with you!

Finn: [laughing] Good reason.

[The two perform their signature fist bump one final time. A new version of the title card is shown, now reading "FINN & JAKE ARE TOGETHER AGAIN."]
