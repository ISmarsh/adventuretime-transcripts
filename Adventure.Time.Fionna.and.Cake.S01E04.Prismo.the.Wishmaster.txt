[The episode begins with the Scarab hunting through a tea shop at night.]
Sammy:  Good night, Sammy. G'night, Normulon.
[Slurping]
Sammy:  I'm sorry, sir, but we're about to close.
Scarab:  Oh, I won't be long, Sammy. [slurping] This might be the most delicious tea I've ever tasted. I almost understand why you abandoned your post for this quaint life. Kheirosiphon.
Sammy:  No. [gasps]
[Groaning, growling]
Sammy:  You! I'm not going back! I don't like sacred flames. I like tea!
[Squeaking]
[All squeaking]
Scarab:  Who's next? No... Finally.
[Beeping]

[Scene changes to Prismo's Time Room. An alarm beeps continuously.]
[Beeping continues]
Wyatt:  [clears throat] Aren't you gonna answer that?
Prismo:  [chuckles nervously] Mr. Prismo. Just ignore it. Make your wish.
Wyatt:  Well, I'm trying to but it's kinda distracting. You have no idea what it took. The terrible things I did just to get here. And now I can't even concentrate!
Prismo:  The wish. Spit it out.
[Beeping continues]
Wyatt:  [sighs] Oh, I wish it was quiet enough to think!
Prismo:  Wish granted.
Wyatt:  Oh, wait. Uh...
[Static hissing, piano music plays]
[No audio]

[Prismo finally answers the call. The TV wall shows Ooo.]
[Beeping continues]
Prismo:  [sighs] Okay, fine.
[Beeping continues]
[Beep]
Prismo:  A crossover. Okay.
[Remote clicks]
Prismo:  Oh, hey! Ooo.
[Remote clicks]
Prismo:  That's not a crossover. Nope.
[Remote clicking]
Prismo:  Nope. Oh, my gosh. You really are Fionna and Cake! The real ones!
Fionna:  Oh, crud!
[Grunting, remote clicking]
Prismo:  Can we go on an adventure?
Fionna:  Heh, well--
Cake:  Aw, my hat!
Fionna:  Ayo! What's going on now, Cake?
Cake:  [distorted voice] I don't know, but this is cool.
Prismo:  What's wrong with Cake's voice? Whoa! Big boy!
Prismo:  No, this is gonna drive me nuts.
Cake:  [normal voice] Hey! Hey! Hey!
Prismo:  She's off-model, too.
[Fingers snap]
Cake:  Whoa! I'm standing on my back legs! Oh! Arms! [gasps] Legs are arms! Amazing! It's like a video game, and we're getting upgrades for beating those weirdos. [gasps] Ha! I can stretch! Hey. Ha ha!
Prismo:  Much better. Do me next!
[Fingers snap]
Fionna:  I just wanted cool powers.
Prismo:  Maybe you have some. Try flying.
Fionna:  [grunts] Ha ha! Faster...
Prismo:  These two are a long way from home. But how? Maybe the connection is open again.
[Modem buzzing, static hissing]
Fionna and Cake:  [gasp]
Prismo:  Nope. Still locked out. Then how did they get here?
Fionna:  I stepped through a portal in that sad man's head.
Prismo:  Better take a closer look.

[Prismo examines Fionna and Cake more closely.]
Prismo:  Now what?
Simon:  For starters, let's get you covered.
[Fingers snap]
Fionna:  Great.
Prismo:  What happened with this one and this one, Simon?
Simon:  I didn't do anything.
Prismo:  Liar. Crossovers don't just happen!
Fionna:  Look, it seems like you two have some stuff to work out so can you send us back to Ooo?
Prismo:  Let's try rewinding.
[Keyboard clacks]
Simon:  What the heck, dude?
Prismo:  Well, you couldn't bring her back so I helped myself.
Fionna:  Who's her?
Prismo:  [sighs] I've got limits to my power, bro. That doesn't give you an excuse to mess with my stuff.
Simon:  Whatever, dude.
[Gulping]
Prismo:  Simon, I mean it. Just because it's in your head doesn't mean it's yours.
Fionna:  I've always wanted to try one of these.
[Remote clicks, static hisses]
[Groaning]
Fionna:  Drink the water, you beast! You... You beast of burden, drink the water. Drink. Drink this water!
[Screaming]
Prismo:  Hey! That's not a toy! Bad cat! Why would you do that?
Cake:  Nobody sprays Cake! Hyah! Who do you think you are, you big bully? And why'd you bring us here? Where is here?
Prismo:  Okay... Chill.
Fionna:  Wow, okay.
Prismo:  I am Prismo the Wishmaster.
Fionna:  That tells me nothing!

[Prismo explains the multiverse to Fionna and Cake.]
Prismo:  Well, as Wishmaster, I grant wishes. And sometimes those wishes require me to create new wish-altered realities. Here, check it out. A wish made this farmworld universe. A wish made this funny shape universe. This one already existed. I don't even remember whose wish this was. This universe is special because it had my favorite guy. Roar! Pancake! There he is! Dog person. Lotsa wishes, lotsa worlds. The Time Room is the perch from which I keep my eye on the resulting multiverse.
Cake:  Okay. Keep going.
Prismo:  I used to really like my job. But after eons of making stuff for others I wondered what it would be like to make something for myself. Let's see. She's gonna be a good fighter so she'll need a badass sword. And everyone needs a best friend. Ooh, cats are cool. And now just to put them in a big ol' tree house on a grassy field in a magical world. Done. Shoot. Did I just copy Finn and Jake? Meh. So I just leaned into it. Maybe it wasn't the most creative thing I could make but I liked writing your stories.
Fionna:  Wait! That's us!
Prismo:  Yeah, totally. You had adventure. You had romance.
Cake:  DJ Flame!
Prismo:  You had friends.
Fionna:  Gum-Garry.
Cake:  [hisses]
Fionna:  Marshall's a vampire.
Fionna and Cake:  [laugh]
Fionna:  Wow, we look so happy.
Cake:  I knew my life was supposed to be magic.
Simon:  Fionna and Cake was real this whole time?
[Gulping]
Prismo:  Pretty tight, right?
Fionna:  Yeah. So why'd you change it?
Cake:  Yeah, our world doesn't look like that at all. Everything's boring as hell.
Simon:  Oh, I think I know what happened.

[Prismo explains how Fionna and Cake's world lost its magic.]
Prismo:  No wonder you guys looked so terrible when you first got here. Okay, so, technically I'm not supposed to make stuff for myself. So I kinda had to hide your universe. I found the emptiest most cursed magical brain in all of Ooo.
Fionna:  Him?
Prismo:  Kinda.
[Remote clicks]
Prismo:  Ice King! Hey, Ice King, can I store a fan-made alternate universe in your cursed dome?
Ice King:  Sure, magic flashlight! You can put anything you want in there. Specially if it's got a hot lady.
Prismo:  Cool. Hold still for upload. Whoa!
Ice King:  Fire in the hole!
[Modem buzzing]
Fionna:  What time is it?
Cake:  What time is it?
[Laughs]
Prismo:  You were like a big nutty hard drive. And everything went great until you got cured.
[Static hisses]
Marceline:  Simon! Your crown!
Ice King:  What's happenin', lady?
Simon:  Don't panic, but I think GOLB is digesting us breaking us apart layer by layer down to our essential forms.
Ice King:  Betty?
Betty:  It's good to see you, Simon.
Simon:  It's good to be seen.
Prismo:  Dang. From fun wizard to sad loser.
Cake:  He wasn't fun. He was insane.
Prismo:  I dunno. He looked pretty happy to me. Without the curse of the magic crown Simon's brain was no longer magical. So your world must have lost its magic, too. And I've been locked out ever since.
Simon:  Betty.
Prismo:  So, all of this is really bad but I think we're gonna be okay. As long as no one else knows.
[Tapping]
Prismo:  Oh, no! Quick, down the stairs!
Fionna:  What stairs?
Cake:  Oh!
Prismo:  Shoot. I'll deal with whoever that is. You guys follow me to the exit.
Simon:  Up...
[Simon grumbles]
[Knocking]
Prismo:  Just a minute!

[Prismo opens the door to find the Scarab.]
[Skittering]
Prismo:  Scarab!
Scarab:  Hey!
Scarab:  Curious. I always thought you had an open door policy. Everybody's pal, Prismo.
Prismo:  Well, What brings you here Scrabby?
Scarab:  [scoffs] No one calls me that anymore. I was passing through the neighborhood making a delivery to the Judgement Hall when I got an alert about you.
Prismo:  [gasps] Me?
Scarab:  Your Universe Breach Alarm went off twice and went ignored?
Prismo:  Oh. I just needed to change the batteries. Nothing for an important guy like you to worry about. Yeah, everything in the Time Room is going great. Yeah, well, thanks for coming by. I know you're really busy, so...
Scarab:  Prismo, it almost seems like you're trying to get rid of me.
Prismo:  What? No... I love it when you stop by. Let's bro out! We can party like we used to.
Scarab:  I was never invited to parties.
Prismo:  Well, time to fix that.

[Meanwhile, Fionna, Cake, and Simon flee through the Time Room.]
Fionna:  [grunts] We just want to go back to Ooo. Why are we hiding?
Prismo:  Remember when I said I wasn't supposed to create new realities for myself? It's actually a big deal and I could get in serious trouble for it. The guy who was at the door, that's the Scarab. He's a jerk god-auditor. And if he finds out about you, he's gonna report me. And then... [sighs] ...my boss is gonna drop the hammer!
Fionna:  Your boss?
Cake:  Gah! Simon!
Cake:  Fionna!
Cake:  [whimpers]
Fionna and Cake:  [laughter]
Cake:  It's okay, Fionna, walking on two legs is hard.
Fionna:  It's not my legs, it's this damn skirt.
Cake:  Girl, you look good though.
Simon:  Weird. You never had any trouble with skirts in my stories.
Fionna:  How about shorts, huh?
Simon:  What? What do you mean "shorts"?
Prismo:  You know, mortals. I call them "shorts" because they're smaller than us. And their lives are really short.
Simon:  [sighs] Having two conversations at the same time is hard.

[The Scarab investigates the Time Room.]
Scarab:  [sniffs] Oh! That's mine.
Scarab:  Is this cat hair yours, too?
Prismo:  I don't recall.
Scarab:  I'd like to take a look around the cube and see if there are any more "batteries" that need changing.
Prismo:  Oh, yeah, of course.
Simon:  Uh-oh. We'll take a shortcut through the core.
Prismo:  Pick up the pace, Simon! You really don't want to get caught by this guy!
Simon:  I don't care. I mean, you show me all my messed-up past and expect me to just shrug it off like it's no big deal. "Just move forward, Simon." Well, maybe I don't want to move forward. Maybe I just want to sit right here.
Prismo:  This guy. Oh, sweet!

[They pass through the Time Core.]
Fionna:  Wow!
[Screeches]
Fionna:  What the heck are those things?
Prismo:  That's the Time Core. I don't think they're actually alive. Maybe? They send time waves throughout the multiverse that are experienced as the passage of time.
Cake:  Now, see, you said that word before and I pretended to understand but I've got the education of a house cat. What's the multi-universe?
Prismo:  I'll show you. This is the multiverse a huge web of all the different realities elegantly connected like an anthill or a camp counselor relationship chart.
Fionna:  Where is our world on this map?
Prismo:  Your universe is unauthorized so, it's way over here.
Cake:  Dang, that looks so lonely.
Prismo:  Yeah, because I kind of made your universe off the books it can't really be part of the multiverse. Just the fact that you exist could have totally unpredictable effects on the other realities. You're like free radicals.
Fionna:  Awesome!
Cake:  That sounds cool!
Prismo:  Yeah.
Prismo:  So majestic. Trillions of waves of time spreading across creation in a mighty gush.
Simon:  Eh, the colors give me a headache.
[All grunting]
Fionna:  Prismo! Are we close?
Prismo:  Just through this door.
Fionna:  Finally! We're going back adventuring! I can't wait!
Prismo:  Is the circle ready?
Prismo:  Just finished.
Prismo:  Oh, hey, what's up?
Prismo:  And the new battery?
Prismo:  You already know. You're me.
Prismo:  Ha-ha. Yeah, this is confusing.
Simon:  Prismo! Where's the exit?
Prismo:  It's been cool hanging out... but you got to go back now.
Fionna:  What?
Cake:  What?
Prismo:  Simon, do the thing with the portal!
Simon:  No way. I am not going through that heartache again.
Fionna:  We're out, too!
Cake:  Stop!
Fionna:  We go where we want!
Prismo:  Fionna! Cake! That's the last time I make an unauthorized universe.
Scarab:  Unauthorized universe?
Prismo:  Crap.

[Fionna and Cake explore the multiverse while Simon stays behind.]
Fionna:  [gasps] What do you think about the stuff he said? Are we not real people?
Cake:  [panting] Heck yeah, we're real! So what if he made us? We're making our own selves from now on!
Fionna:  I always knew you were a smart cat.
Cake:  [laughs]
Prismo:  Come on, Scrabby. Let's make a deal. I can get you anything you want! A new ride? Big dung ball?
Prismo:  Not my hot and spicy.
Scarab:  You just handed me the only thing I want.
Prismo:  My pickles?
Scarab:  The Time Room! I should have been Wishmaster and I will be! All I have to do is turn in your rogue universe to prove you're unworthy.
Prismo:  What am I worried about? You'll never find him.
Scarab:  It's hidden in a person?
Prismo:  Crap...
Scarab:  He's here, isn't he?
Prismo:  No.
Prismo:  I donked up.
Simon:  Join the club.
[Burps]

[Fionna and Cake find themselves running in circles through the multiverse.]
Fionna:  [panting] We've been running for so long, I'm gonna throw up.
Cake:  There's a light up ahead. It must be the exit!.
Prismo:  Hold on!
Fionna:  Adventure time!
Cake:  Adventure time!
Fionna:  What's up?
Cake:  What the heck? Did you just make us go through a big circle?
Prismo:  [chuckles] Okay, we're out of time. You need to get back inside his head now.
Scarab:  Found you! The crossovers. You're evidence. You're getting egged, too. And after that into the incinerator with the rest of the trash.
Fionna:  No!
Prismo:  They're Fionna and Cake and they go where they want!
Prismo:  [grunts] Run! And keep running! This dude will hunt you like a polar bear!
Cake:  Prismo...
Prismo:  Hit the button and hold on tight to each other!
Simon:  What's the point?
Fionna:  Ow!
Cake:  You dum-dum! If you don't help us, Simon, our entire world and everyone we know will die! Please! Help us!
[Banging, grunts]
Prismo:  Go!
Simon:  Actually, I think I might be able to--
[Gasps]

[Fionna, Cake, and Simon land in a strange new world.]
Fionna and Cake:  [gasp]
Cake:  Are we back in the magic world?
Fionna:  No, this doesn't look like Ooo.
Fionna and Cake:  [both groan]
Cake:  What are we gonna do? That bug guy's still after us and we can't take him on.
Simon:  I used to be able to stop whole armies of jerks like that but I'm useless now.
Fionna:  Uh, yeah, we know.
Cake:  Maybe this can get us back.
Fionna:  Yeah! Let's just button mash it.
Simon:  Wait... We don't know what channel number corresponds to Ooo. We could end right back in the Time Room where the Scarab will bite my head off!
Cake:  Well, I could use a bite. I'm hungry, Fionna.
Fionna:  I'll check my new backpack.
Cake:  Got anything in that big ol' muumuu?
Simon:  Oh, found something. Sandwiches!
Fionna and Cake:  [munching]
Simon:  [sighs] I know a way I can protect you from the Scarab bring back magic to your world, and make it last forever. I need to become Ice King again.
Fionna and Cake:  [both gulp]
