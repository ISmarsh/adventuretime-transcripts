[The episode begins in Fionna's world. Magic has returned and creatures roam the streets.]
[Sighs]
Fionna:  Where...
Fionna:  [gasps]
[Growls]
Ellis P:  [laughs] Hey, girl.
Fionna:  Ellis P?
Ellis P:  Look at me. I'm even more beautiful now. Chase me, Stanley.
Fionna:  Wait. Where's Cake?
Cake:  Fionna! Fionna!
Fionna:  Cake!
[Both chuckle, grunt]
Cake:  It worked. Simon did it.
Fionna:  Let's go to our house. Yeah. We can throw a party.
Cake:  I feel snacky. People eat cake at parties, right?
Fionna:  Let's get one from BB's.
Cake:  Gary? Are you here? We're throwing a party.
Gary:  [gasps]
Fionna:  Gary?
Gary:  [groans] Fionna. You're back. Try my new pastry.
[Grunts]
[Fionna and Cake gasp]
Fionna:  It's you!
Gary:  [chomping]
[Breathing shakily, panting]
Fionna:  Marshall?
Marshall Lee:  [screeching]
[Both scream]
[Both panting]
Fionna:  Our building.
LSP:  No, no. Don't do it, Stanley. My spaghetti!
[Squirrels hiss]
LSP:  Wait! I'm too pretty to get eat!
[Panting]
[Both panting]
Fionna:  Okay, we're safe now. I'll put in a video game. You go make us margaritas I've always wanted to try one of those.
Simon:  Are you happy, Fionna? All this for you.
Fionna:  Fionna.
[Grunts]
Cake:  Fionna, wake up. You alright?
Fionna:  It's-- It's normal.
Cake:  Yeah, I know. I had the worst dream. When Simon put on the crown it all went wrong.
Fionna:  Gary became a scary gum blob and Marshall Lee was a hideous monster...
Cake:  A hideous monster...
Fionna:  ...that burst into flames.
Cake:  ...that burst into flames.
Fionna:  [gasps]
Cake:  Yeah.
Fionna:  Did you see Simon in the freezer?
Cake:  Simon in the freezer!
Fionna:  What if it was an omen?
Cake:  It was just a nightmare. I can't wait for this dump to change. Look at that. It even has lip sync.

[They visit an ice rink to look for signs of magic.]
Rink Worker:  Can I help you?
Fionna:  We didn't know this rink had a mascot.
[Skaters scream]
Fionna:  [laughs] My butt is an icicle. [gasps, chuckles]
[Grunts]
Rink Worker:  Hey, get off the ice. No skates, no entry.
Fionna:  Yeah... I'm going.
[Gasps]
Fionna:  This place is gonna be magic soon, I can feel it.
Cake:  There. That squirrel is reading.
Fionna:  Magic.
Cake:  False alarm.
Fionna:  Marshall and Gary?
[Marshall and Gary gasp]
Gary:  Fionna.
Marshall Lee:  Cool threads. You been thrifting?
Fionna:  What-- What-- What is this?
Gary:  Fionna, where have you been? You just disappeared.
Fionna:  Okay, this is gonna blow your mind but our whole world is inside this guy Simon's head and everything we know is about to turn crazy magical. Any second now. Simon, what's the hold up?
[Sighs, groans]

[Simon awakens inside GOLB and confronts the Lich.]
Simon:  [gasps] The crown.
[Gasps]
Simon:  Where am I?
Lich:  Scared of the darkness that lay before your eyes... and flapping your wings you whirled about and through this world you brought...
Simon:  Hey! Lich! What did you do to my spell, huh?
Lich:  Great embodiment of chaos, hear me. For ages untold I studied your ways devoting my existence to you. I strove to be your vassal on the physical plane to build mountains of bodies in your honor to extinguish all life and in my universe, this I achieved. But it gave me no satisfaction. In succeeding, I lost all purpose.
Simon:  I know what you mean.
Lich:  Why? Why must this be?
[Grunts]
Simon:  Hear me, Golb.
Fionna:  GOLB?
[Rumbling]
Simon:  Betty, are you in there? Even a little? I finally get to you when I'm not even trying. I've-- I've wanted to see you again for so long.
GOLBetty:  No...
Simon:  Answer me. What more could I have done? What do you want from me now?
GOLBetty:  [growls] What?
[Screaming]

[Simon is transported through time and confronts his feelings about Betty.]
Simon:  [gasps] Betty, I really tried to fix you. I searched for years for a way to undo this... but I failed. Living among the humans in Ooo I felt completely out of place and time. My life had been drained of all meaning. You gave me a second chance and I've wasted it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Betty. When I first did the ritual I just wanted to come here and tell you that... But then something else happened. I met two people who really needed my help Fionna and Cake. You would have liked them. They'll use a second chance better than I ever did. You of all people should understand why I must do this. I finally have a purpose now.
[Gasps]

[Scene shifts to far-future Ooo with Shermy and Beth.]
Pup Guard:  By the order of Gibbon, find them!
Shermy:  This way.
Pup Guard:  Halt!
[Shermy and Beth gasp]
Shermy:  Shoot.
Shermy:  Hey, Beth, launch me.
Shermy:  Yeah!
[Grunts]
Shermy:  Come on, Beth.
Beth:  On it. Yeah. Keep it coming.
Beth:  Look out!
[Panting, grunts]
Pup Guard:  Vandals! You wont get away with this! Gibbon doesn't forgive!
[Both laugh]
Shermy:  Yeah, that was great.
Beth:  Good technique on those little stink lines, Shermy. Step four of the revolution... check.
[Sniffs]
Shermy:  Take that, Gibbon!
Beth:  And that! Oh! You got me! Tell my kids. I resent them.
Shermy:  Quit wiggling around, you nugget or you're walkin'.
Beth:  If I'm going to the library you're going to have to carry me.
Simon:  [gasps] I finally have a purpose now.
Beth:  You just got real weird there.
Shermy:  Shermy? What?
Beth:  [clicks tongue] Your legs aren't broken. You can walk.
Simon:  [gasps] What just happened? I'm in another weird version of Ooo.
Beth:  Bread balls!
Shermy:  Language.
Simon:  Betty, why did you send me here? And in this body? Why, why, why?
Beth:  Shermy, are you going through puberty?
Simon:  This is going to sound farfetched but I'm not Shermy. My name is Simon Petrikov. I'm from another world far different than your own.
Beth:  Okay, "Simon." You're not getting out of going to the library by acting weird.
Simon:  Library? That's great, actually. I could really use a library right now.
Beth:  Are you making fun of me?
Simon:  No... I love the library.
Beth:  Okay. I like this new you.
Simon:  Fionna and Cake are still waiting for their magic world. I'll find myself another crown. You can zap me to whatever alternate universe you want but I have free will. Do you hear me, Betty? Do you...

[Simon is transported to another body.]
Simon:  Hear me, Betty? Do you hear me, Betty?
Simon:  [groans]
[Grunting]
[Gasps]
Simon:  I keep stepping on my tail. This will take some getting used to.
Scarab:  Stay out of this.
Cat:  Ooh, sparkly.
Scarab:  What's the matter, Simon? Spell malfunction? I'm a professional and professionals don't hold grudges.
[Screeching, growls]
[Screeching, growls]

[Back in Fionna's world, Fionna explains everything to Marshall and Gary.]
Gary:  So you're not a robot? You're a magic cat?
Cake:  Yes, I always was. I'm just back to my original form. And pretty soon, you will be, too.
Marshall Lee:  But if everything's gonna change will we still be together?
Cake:  Maybe? In the world we all came from Gary was a candy prince, and you were a cool vampire.
Gary:  Sick.
Marshall Lee:  Vampire?
Cake:  Well, we did see a world where versions of y'all tried to kill each other so there's that option.
Cake:  Fionna and I got into a big fight in that place.
Cake:  Hey... Don't worry. We smoothed it over.
Fionna:  Honestly, I don't know if you'll even remember each other. Or if anyone will remember this version of our world.
Gary:  But I don't want to forget anything. Marshall and I just met.
Marshall Lee:  Yeah.
Fionna:  Oh, I told you it shouldn't be up to us to decide. Maybe we can make requests. That Simon guy's thoughts affect our world, right?
Gary:  Yeah, like, if Simon knows Marshall and I are supposed to be together it could work out?
Marshall Lee:  And I'd still date you if you were a vampire.
Marshall Lee:  It's worth a shot. Simon can do anything. Just gotta find a portal.
Fionna:  B.R.B.
Cake:  Blue sparkles...
Fionna:  There. Portal.
Cake:  Can you hear me, Simon?
[Gasps, screeching]
Fionna:  Big damn bugs.
Cake:  The Scarab.
[Mini Scarabs laughing maniacally]
Fionna:  [grunts] Just leave us alone.
Marshall Lee:  So is this part of the fun magic?
[Mini Scarabs laughing maniacally]
Fionna:  Oh, no.

[Simon, in Shermy's body, searches for answers in the library.]
Beth:  Simon, what's going on?
Simon:  Have there been any significant ice events in this world?
Beth:  Not recently.
Simon:  Who has the magic crown now?
Beth:  What crown?
Simon:  It's gold and pointy, set with red gems--
Beth:  We have to be quiet now.
Simon:  Where's the books?
Beth:  What are you waiting for? Come on.
Simon:  One of these has to be about ice magic or the crown.
Beth:  Just throw some down. Preferably something about high technology transcendental meditation, or trashy romance.
[Grunts]
Simon:  Yes. Simon, we should go.
Beth:  Just a minute. Don't you hear it?
Shermy:  Euripides.
Beth:  Sherm-- Simon.
[Roars]
Simon:  Pagelings.
[Groans]
Pagelings:  Return your books.
Simon:  I need that book.
Pagelings:  [groaning] Show us your card. Show us your card. Return your books! Return your books!
Beth:  This is not working out.
[Mini Scarabs laughing]
Simon:  That's so annoying.
Prismo:  Keep them apart.
[Hisses]
Simon:  Gimme that.
Simon:  [snarls] Hunter.
Beth:  I love all plants and animals but not these things.
[Grunting]
[Whispering indistinctly]
Fionna:  Got it.
Fionna:  Hey, Scarabs. I got your dumb crystal. Come and get it.
[Mini Scarabs breathing rapidly]
[Mini Scarabs yelling]
Cake:  I can feel their little, tiny feet.
[Yelling continues]
Prismo:  [grunting] I shoulda kept up the medicine-ball routines. Come on, Prismo.
[Grunts]
Prismo:  He-hey! Who needs a gym?
[Grunts]
Prismo:  Gotta help Fionna and Cake.
[Mini Scarabs chittering]
Fionna:  [grunts]
[Gags]
[Chittering continues]
[Bones crack]
Fionna:  I need a bath.
Cake:  So if this Scarab reforms he's going to destroy our entire reality?
Prismo:  And we can't kill him because he's immortal?
Fionna:  A Godlike being outdone by a humble cheese-ball barrel.
Cake:  So, do we just keep them in jars, like forever?
Prismo:  [groans] Will they still try to kill us when the world resets?
Fionna:  [groans] I don't know. I don't even know what's going on with Simon or why the Scarab got in.
Cake:  Simon must still be alive or else we'd be blinked out of existence.
Prismo:  What'd you bugs do to Simon?
Scarab:  Abominations!
Fionna:  Just call him.
Cake:  I gave him my phone. You know, to play Worm when he was all alone.
Marshall Lee:  That's my phone. Can I borrow this?
Fionna:  Oh, wait, the pass code is--
Cake:  Shh. I know.
[Line ringing]
Fionna:  It's ringing.
Simon:  Beth...
[Cellphone vibrating]
Simon:  Beth, where's the book? I wanna see...
Beth:  The book! I need to see the book.
Simon:  We're almost to the ol' reading spot.
Beth:  Which one's got you so worked up?
Simon:  "Ancient Artifacts written by..." I can't read the author's name.
Beth:  What luck-- This world's Simon Petrikov wrote a history of the crown, too.
Simon:  The invisible forces of the universe [grunts] must have wanted [grunts] me to find this.
Beth:  That's not how you...
Simon:  I know how to read. I have degrees.
Beth:  Chill. Why do you want to read this one so badly?
Simon:  The fate of my friends depends on me finding a magic crown and that is the best chance I have of locating it.
Beth:  They're waiting. They're waiting for their magical...
Beth:  Okay, Simon. Let's save your friends, then.
[Trigger clicks]
Simon:  "Ready for adventure?" This looks like one of those choose-your-own-choice deals.
Beth:  Oh, like the ancient game books of my world.
Simon:  "Fire once for yes. Fire twice for no."
[Trigger clicks]
Simon:  "This is the story about two best friends Casper and Nova. They are both great explorers. We meet them on their great quest to document and preserve important talismans. They journey through the Gobblebad Caverns and lodge near a sunken city in the seaside town of Scandia. There they hear a rumor about a magic crown."
Beth:  The crown.
Simon:  "A crown guarded by a deadly fire tiger who lives atop the volcanic mountain of Yag."
Beth:  Yog?
Simon:  Yag. "Casper wants to go for it. Nova is really excited to search for artifacts in the nearby ancient sea ruins but she would be cool with going with Casper's plan, too. Which thing should they explore? Fire once for Casper's quest. Fire twice for Nova's."
Beth:  We have to go for the crown.
Simon:  I don't know. The sea ruins could be fun, too.
Beth:  Finding the crown is a literal matter of life and death for a whole world of living souls!
Simon:  I'm digging the commitment to this bit. Casper, then.
[Trigger clicks, chomp]
Simon:  "Casper is bitten, and the crown has already been stolen by moon demons." Dang it. Maybe we can go back and try the sea-ruins route.
Beth:  Good idea.
Simon:  "Casper is bitten, and the crown has already been stolen."
Beth:  No do-overs with this book, I guess.
[Line ringing]
[Mini Scarabs chittering]
Fionna:  Where are the games on this thing?
Cake:  I'm watching TV.
Fionna:  [voicemail] Leave a message. Blehh.
[Cellphone beeps]
Cake:  Either the phone isn't working or Simon is too hurt to answer.
Prismo:  What would the barflies from Cheers do in this situation?
TV:  Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
TV:  Somebody left the door open.
TV:  Hey, I'm walkin here.
[Laughter]
Fionna:  I'm gonna go back through the portal.
Cake:  The blue sparkles again?
Gary:  Hey, I saw a glowing opening with blue sparkles out there in the park.
Marshall Lee:  I'll take you there.
Fionna:  Let's go, Cake.
Fionna:  We'll look, too.
Marshall Lee:  Really?
Fionna:  We can cover more ground if we look for portals everywhere. I could even call my mom, if we have to.
[Door closes]
[Yawns]
[Mini Scarabs whining]
LSP:  Oh, my gob! What are you doing to these beautiful creatures? Be free, my babies! Be free!
[Mini Scarabs chittering]
LSP:  Freedom! I saved you!
Fionna:  Does everybody know where they're headed?
[Knuckles crack]
