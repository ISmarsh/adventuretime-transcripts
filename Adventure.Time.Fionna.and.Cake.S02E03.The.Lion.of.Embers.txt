[laughing maniacally]
Ice Queen:  Oh, come on. It's funny.
[- [Ice Queen yells] - Look out!]
[Fionna exclaims]
Fionna:  [groans] Chill out, Ice Queen! You're just jealous of my new fuel boy. Fionna, help! Let me out of here!
[growls]
Fionna:  Whoa! The more you struggle, the more steam you make for my Ice-O-Tomaton. Let Flame Prince go, ya creep! Or else!
[Fionna gasps]
Fionna:  No one hurts Cake!
[- [Ice Queen exclaims] - [ice shattering]]
[penguins quack]
[Cake groans]
Cake:  Cakey! [softly] Sorry.
[heavy footsteps]
[coughing]
Cake:  Fionna... [groans] Let's go! Ya-yah! FP! Please be okay.
[- [Flame Prince] Mmm. - [Fionna chuckles]]
Cake:  Hot. Oh! Really hot.
[nervous groan]
Cake:  We gotta jet!
[both panting]
[- Ah! - [Flame Prince groans]]
[yells]
Cake:  I'm gonna be late.
[panting]
[- Out of my way. - [groans] Dude.]
Cake:  Wow, what a jerk. Nice outfit, though.
[opening theme music playing]
Fionna:  Well, that's big talk, coming from you. Yeah? Oh, yeah? Is that so? Well, you know what, Queenie? Screw you! You can take your interest rate and cram it in your escrow. Queenie wants $50,000.
[- [Gary, Marshall gasp] - [Ellis P] Gasp.]
Fionna:  And I kind of pissed her off. So if it's not in her hands by the end of the week, The Sweet Spot's gonna be turned into a parking lot. No! But parking lots do nothing to revitalize neighborhoods. [sighs] So it's come to this.
[- [coins jingling] - [others gasp]]
Fionna:  Forgive me, Lil' P! [grunts] I don't think this is legal tender. [Ellis P] Actually, I'm gonna need that back to buy a new piggybank. Thanks for trying, Ellis.
DJ Slime:  <i>Next up,</i> <i>DJ Flame's hot new single--</i> Marshall, your mom's loaded. Ask her for money. No way. Come on, rich boy. Cough it up-- We could do a bake sale? I'll make gourmet cookies. Can you bake like a million of 'em? Or one really expensive cookie? Like some kind of fundraiser. Oh, yeah, I see my mom pull in a lot of money from those. Tell me everything we need.
Marshall:  Well, you need to find a venue, invite performers, sell tickets and merch.
Fionna:  Write it down. I'll never remember all that. This is perfect. And Marshall can play the music. Oh. Uh... I don't do big crowds.
Fionna:  But you're so good. Nah. Yeah, babe, you'd be so great. Okay, fine. Yes!
Marshall:  But no covers.
Gary:  I'll be the treasurer. Ooh, I can't wait to balance some receipts.
Cake:  And I'll get started on a sick logo!
Babyworld Finn:  Ooh! Take him back to Peptank. I got an idea for where we could host the fundraiser. This is gonna work, you guys. I freaking know it!
[door closes]
Cosmic Owl:  Booyah! You owe me 20 crystals. Dang, I really thought Babyworld Finn was gonna eat her. Thirty crystals on Huntress drying out before Fionna notices.
Scarab:  What are you doing, Prismo? Why are you letting this crossover slide? Eh, it's not our jurisdiction. Get in the tub, Scrabby.
Scarab:  But she's in the wrong universe! Cutie. The forces that brought Huntress to Fionnaworld are beyond the multiverse.
Scarab:  There's nothing "beyond" the multiverse. Okay, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you've been cool. This is the multiverse as you know it. And this is what she's dealing with.
Scarab:  Whoa! Like I said, not our problem.
Scarab:  Then whose problem is it? Who cares? I just want to play games and not think about all this stuff.
[beeping]
Scarab:  [groans] Another croak dream. Croak dream!
[Cosmic Owl sighs]
Scarab:  Later, Prismo. Dude, I love croak dreams.
Scarab:  But the green stuff, I have so many questions.
Prismo:  Shh! I wanna see who bites it. Mmm. He's definitely poisoned, and it's killing him. But it's also keeping him alive somehow. How does that make sense? I don't know. It doesn't. Finn, I'll kill you if you die on us! I can fix him. I just need more samples.
[indistinct chatter]
Prismo:  Do you guys hear that?
[Simon mumbles]
[chatter grows louder]
Simon:  Peebs!
[princesses chatter]
[- Please stand back, ladies. - [agitated chatter]]
Princess Bubblegum:  Princesses! What do you guys want? We heard Finn is in a death-like sleep. He needs the power of a true love's kiss to revive him. [blows raspberry] That's fairy tale woo hoo!
Lumpy Space:  Out of my way, pigs! [grunts] I'm the only true love Finn needs. [grunts] Don't push.
[indistinct shouting]
Lumpy Space:  This is exciting. Banana guards! Lock the gates. Yes, Mom. Ugh! Turtle Princess, I need backup. These tranches are trying to steal my boy. That little miser wants 50K. So we need a cheap venue for this weekend. That much, huh? Please stand back, Fionna. And I was thinking, you know, the air is free, so... why not do it in the park? And I figured you could help us with that. I can't authorize that. But I can set you up with the park committee. Really? Of course. Now, seriously, step back. Thanks! Fionna!
[Fionna exclaims]
[exclaims in Spanish]
Fionna:  Hold on! I'm okay. [laughs] Talk to you later. Ouch. I'm such a dummy.
[Fionna groans]
DJ Flame:  Oh, shoot, sorry. Are you okay?
[- [groans] - Fionna?]
Fionna:  Phelix? Oh, wow, Fionna. Sorry again. I'm tough. I'm a tough guy. Oh, yeah, I know. You saved the world. That was seriously badass. Oh. [giggles] Yeah. But I don't like to brag about it. What's new with you? Oh, I've got a new song out. It's kind of blowing up, and I don't mind bragging about it. I haven't heard it. Classic Fionna. I'm playing over at The Belly tonight. You should totally come. Oh, I don't know. It's kind of... pricey. No, no. I'll put you on the guest list. Yeah, okay, I'll be there. Sorry, can I just... It was driving me crazy. I'm glad I ran into you. Me too. I'll see you tonight.
[heart beating softly]
[- [pounding on door] - [guards yelp]]
Fionna:  Hey, man, they're princesses. Don't use the pointy part. Use the lemniscate end. Is that what it's called?
[- [grunts] - [guards] Oh, Glob!]
[yelling and grunting]
Fionna:  It's a princess invasion!
[princesses yelling]
Fionna:  It's bad out there.
[yells]
Fionna:  We'll figure it out. Yeah, and Huntress Wizard is working on something.
[- I think. - [Princess Bubblegum panting]]
Fionna:  What? Forest magic? We don't have time to wait for Huntress Wizard. The longer he's like this, the harder it's gonna be to get him back. Don't flip out on me now, PB, but maybe we should give this kiss thing a go. A kiss can't bring somebody back from the brink of death. That's not what you told me last night. [blows] I did say that.
[sips, retches]
Fionna:  Hmm. It needs something eye-catching.
[Bandit, Kee-oth laugh]
Fionna:  Stolen cotton candy just tastes sweeter. Hmm? Oh, Lord, girl.
[exhales]
Fionna:  "Hey, it's Cake. Wanna hang out tonight?"
[beep, ding]
Fionna:  "Yeah! What did you have in mind?"
[whimpers, yells]
Fionna:  Huh? What's a cool thing to do on a date? Oh... Well, in my day, we'd go dancing. Cake! We're going clubbing. I can't believe he's gonna be here in person. I know. I'm dying. Who are they talking about? Hmm? I don't really know what they're speaking to. Why do you look so good? Uh... Why do you, sexy? You like it? Thanks. [banana guards] Aww... Um... I-- I like your harness. Fionna Campbell. Come on, guys.
[EDM music playing]
EDM:  It's a lot louder in here than I expected. What?
[- DJ Slime! - [slime noise]]
EDM:  Listen up, all you party people. [person] Whoo! It's t-t-t-time for the guy you've all been waiting for... DJ Sli... Flame! <i>♪ Deej D-D-D-D-DJ Flame</i> <i>Flame Flame ♪</i>
[crowd cheering]
EDM:  ♪ <i>DJ Flame Flame Flame ♪</i> Fionna, seriously? He broke up with you. In a text message! He only broke up with me because his feelings were getting too real and he was afraid. You only dated for a few weeks. It was six months. Oh, yeah.
[sighs]
EDM:  Our souls are connected. I can't explain it, but I know there's something there. This is a bad idea. What do you know about relationships?
[- I... - [phone beeps]]
Cake:  "Sorry. It's too loud. I'm gonna bounce."
[- No! - [door slams open]]
[- [faint music] - [door shuts]]
[music playing]
Cake:  Hey, hey. My girl's here! Come on up, baby.
[- [crowd cheering] - [man] Oh, my God!]
Woman:  She's so hot!
[cheering and whistling]
[gulping]
Huntress Wizard:  Hmm. [raspy] Spirit Warrior. What can I get ya?
[smacking lips]
Huntress Wizard:  I had the cure for Finn right in my hand, and I lost it. How do I get back to that gnarly root space? How do I get home? Oh, you want to go where everyone knows your name? [gulps] Yes. What do you call this? Uh... beet? Follow the beet to the roots. I use this to get underground. Underground... A broken tool seeks the flame. I'm about to croak from thirst. That's all my good advice. You're on your own, kiddo. [raspy] Fat help... you are...
[smooches]
Huntress Wizard:  Huh.
Hotdog Princess:  Little help, please. Muah! That was practice!
[exclaiming]
Hotdog Princess:  Keep it moving. Doesn't this feel kind of wrong? [sighs] I don't love it, but I'm willing to try anything right now. Just think of it as magic CPR. Is CPR wrong? Uh...
[- [thudding] - [murmuring]]
[all gasp]
[- Whoa. - Oh!]
Hotdog Princess:  I did not expect that. So rugged. It's her.
[murmuring]
Hotdog Princess:  Hey, F the H... On Death's Door, but still as pretty as ever. You know... I really did love you.
[gulps, groans]
[groaning]
Hotdog Princess:  "Cake, I'm really sorry I messed up your date. I love you."
[groans]
[- [knocking at door] - Hunter?]
Hotdog Princess:  Hunter, are you in there?
Hunter:  Yeah. Give me a sec. Oh. Uh, sorry. Fionna.
[- Hey, Hunter... - Are you okay?]
Hunter:  Uh, you know, sometimes you're into someone and they're sending signals they're into you, too. But then it turns out to be all in your head? [crying] I thought he liked me. Who? DJ Flame! But he's with a new girl, and she's basically a copycat version of me! You mean Fennel? That's her name? [blows raspberry] I hate everything about her. Fennel's actually really cool. We've known each other forever. Oh, uh... Damn it! What is wrong with me? Hey, there's nothing wrong with you, Fionna. You're... You're so, so nice. Whoa, no. I mean, I like you, but... you're drunk and not thinking clearly. I'm so clear. Fionna. Shit! I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. I'll just go. Can I walk you home? Stop being so nice!
[sighs in exasperation]
Hunter:  Well, Phoebe, guess you weren't "The One." Eh, it was a long shot. I am seeing someone else now. Get out! Who is it? I'm single. Let me try. No, Muscle Princess! His weakened lips!
Muscle Princess:  I'm made of love!
[Simon exclaiming]
Simon:  Princesses, wait! There is something you can do to help.
[phone buzzing]
[line ringing]
Simon:  Of course Simon's not picking up. He's probably busy riding baby dragons and smooching gumdrop gals. I saved the world...
[munching]
Simon:  ...and I'm still a loser. God! I can't even keep a stupid plant alive.
[crying]
[sniffles]
Simon:  Where's my happily ever after?
[snoring]
[sheep bleating]
Simon:  Eat well, my stupid flock. Hmm?
[low growl]
[Big Destiny grunts]
[- Bam! - [wolf whines]]
Simon:  [grunts] Whoo! Huh? Uh... Just ignore me. Hoot. Good night, Daddy.
[- Hoot... - [yells]]
[panting]
Simon:  Of course! T'was but a stupid dream. Big D could never be defeated in the real style world. No way.
[wolf snarls]
[Big Destiny yells]
Simon:  Good night, Daddy.
Big Destiny:  Peanut.
[- [piercing] - [Big Destiny groans]]
Big Destiny:  Damn. Choice croak dream.
[soft music playing]
Big Destiny:  Fred Films.
